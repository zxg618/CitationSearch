The invention discloses a novel method for activating 7-halogen of fluoroquinoline-3carboxylic acid and application thereof in forming a side chain with secondary amine by using condensation. The structure of a novel complex of fluoroquinoline-3-carboxylicacid phenyloboricacid, which is provided by the invention, is shown as the formula XV, wherein Y is C or N; R1 is hydrogen, a methyl, an ethyl, an n-propyl, an isopropyl, a cyclopropyl or a benzyl; R2 is hydrogen, a methyl, an ethyl, an n-propyl, an isopropyl, a methoxyl, an ethyoxyl, fluorine or chlorine, or the R1 is connected with the R2 to ensure that R1-N-C-C-R2 forms a six-membered ring; when Y is N, the R2 does not exist; and X is fluorine or chlorine. The novel complex can be safely and conveniently applied to carrying out a condensation reaction with the secondary amine on 7-position for preparing quinoline keto acid antibiotics such as Moxifloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Danofloxacin, Gemifloxacin, Levofloxacin, and the like.
