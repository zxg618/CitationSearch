The invention discloses a titanium environmental pigment with a compound mineralizer. The titanium environmental pigment comprises 60-80 parts of titanium dioxide, 15-40 parts of nitrate, 3-20 parts of compound mineralizer, and also comprises 10-15 parts of antimonous oxide. The preparation method comprises the following steps: adding titanium dioxide or titanium dioxide and antimonous oxide to a water solution into which a surfactant is dissolved; adding a water-insoluble mineralizer and the nitrate after evenly dispersing; slowly dropwise adding a lye clear liquor, and controlling the adding response speed, nucleation and growth speeds of a nanometer material and a pH value, and then aging, so that the shape of the nanometer hydroxide formed at the surface of the titanium dioxide is a similar spherical shape, the particle size is about 25-40nm; rinsing, so that the content of the impurity is lower than 20ppm; adding the mineralizer dissolved into water to the rinsed slurry to carry out spray drying when the pH value of the solution is in a near-neutral state, and then burning the dried powder in a muffle furnace, so as to obtain pigment powder which is bright in color and luster, narrow in particle size distribution range and strong in tinting strength after heat preservation.

The invention discloses environment-friendly titanium pigment prepared by using a complexation-precipitation process. The process comprises the following steps: quantitatively weighing titanium dioxide or titanium dioxide and antimonous oxide to be added into a solution into which a surfactant is dissolved, and dispersing uniformly; adding a mixture solution of coloring ions R<+1> and a complexing agent, controlling the contents of the complexing agent and the coloring ions so as to establish a stable system of the coloring irons and the complexing agent, adjusting the pH value of the system and enabling the system to be in a stable state; performing precipitation reaction on the coloring ions and an dropped alkali solution; aging and subsequently washing and filtering the reaction system so as to remove impurity ions; performing spraying drying treatment; adding a mineralizer into the dry powder, uniformly mixing, subsequently calcining in air atmosphere in a muffle furnace, and controlling the temperature and the temperature preserving time so as to obtain expected powder. The pigment overcomes the defects that in the conventional titanium yellow preparation, the particle size of the pigment is large, the distribution interval is wide, the color is not bright, agglomeration happens, the coloring capability is poor, and the like, and the cost of the titanium pigment is greatly lower than that of a developed product in market.
