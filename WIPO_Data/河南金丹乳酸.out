The invention discloses an applying method of a multi-functional falling-film concentrating setting in the production of lactic acid, wherein, the multi-functional falling-film concentrating setting has at least four evaporators, a heat pump, loading and discharging pumps with each effect, a vacuum device, a detecting instrument, pipes and valves, wherein, the loading method of the multi-functional falling-film concentrating device can adopt a downstream continuous loading method or a reverse stream loading method, also can adopt a mixed stream loading method. The applying method of the multi-functional falling-film concentrating setting in the production of a lactic acid has a large material processing quantity, which can reach 32 tones for each hour, wherein, the content of the solid material is 15 percent, the concentration proportion can reach as high as six times and the concentration of the discharging can reach 40 to 85 percent. The applying method of the multi-functional falling-film concentrating setting in the production of lactic acid has a relatively high heat transfer coefficient, which saves the heating size and reduces the equipment investment. As the invention adopts a vapor spraying pump to evaporate multi-functionally, the vapor can be used for a plurality of times, the consumption of vapor can reach 1.0 MPa when saturated, and the largest discharging capacity can reach 6250 kilograms per hour; the material pump has a small matching power, the total power of the electric motor is only 250 kw, thus having evident energy-saving effect.

The present invention relates to a method used for separating calcium sulfate in the production of lactic acid. The concentrated solution of calcium lactate is heated until crystals are completely dissolved; sulfuric acid is added for acidolysis so that the reaction can be fully completed to prepare decomposing material solution; ammonium oxalate and barium chloride are used for testing; the decomposing terminal is controlled to be slightly in excess; after 3 to 6 hours, the reaction terminal is adjusted to be in balance to prevent the excess of the sulfuric acid, lower the viscosity of the material solution and prevent the production of slightly soluble calcium sulfate; after the reaction, the material solution is heated to boil and is continuously mixed to form lamellar crystals; a belt filter is used for filtering; the filtrate is filtered again by an ultrafiltration membrane; the treated solution is treated according to the ordinary way in the next process. In the method, the belt filter reduces the occupied area, solves the problem of the crossflow of sewage that has caused trouble in production for a plurality of years, and improves the production environment. The automated operation lowers the labor intensity, and improves the operating conditions. The equipment has the advantages of simple structure, small size, light weight and low investment in infrastructure. The method greatly improves the production efficiency and saves the labor power and materials.
