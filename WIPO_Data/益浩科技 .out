A stamper which has a surface coated with alumina formed by anodizing and gives a stamped surface having neither macro irregularities nor color unevenness; a process for producing the stamper; and a process for producing with the stamper a molding having a stamped surface having neither macro irregularities nor color unevenness. The stamper is characterized by having been produced from an aluminum base die which is made of aluminum having a purity of 99.5% or higher and has a surface having an average crystal-grain diameter of 1 mm or smaller and an arithmetic average roughness (Ra) of 0.05 µm or smaller, by forming alumina having a finely roughened structure on the surface of the die by anodizing. By using this stamper, a molding can be produced which has a stamped surface having neither macro irregularities nor color unevenness and is suitable for use as an antireflective article, etc.
