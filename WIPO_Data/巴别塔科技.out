The invention relates to a wireless tunnel wakening notification method, comprising an application server and a handset client which are under a HTTP protocol. The handset client sends a connection request to the application server; the connection to a long channel of the handset client is established; when the application server has new data updating, the application server wakens the long connecting channel and sends a data updating notification to the handset client through the long connecting channel; after the handset client acquires the data updating notification, the handset client begins to automatically acquire updated data through a logic processing channel. In the invention, the long connecting channel is kept between the application server and the handset client, so the method has good receiving real-time performance, quick speed and high receiving efficiency; the handset client also does not need to initiatively request to inquire whether the application server has data updating for many times, which can decrease mobile data network flow and save the electric quantity consumed by the client, save the mobile data network flow, relieve the pressure of the application server, and save server resources.

The invention relates to a wireless data transfer method which includes application servers under an http agreement, a mobile phone client and a data terminal server. The mobile client is connected with the application server through a wireless communication network; the application server is connected with the data terminal server through the internet; an xml parser is arranged in the application server; a custom xml file format is arranged in the xml parser; business data are analyzed into xml business data by the xml parser and are transferred into the data which can be recognized by the mobile phone. By adopting the design of the xml parser, the invention can simply transfer an original business data type into the data type which can be recognized by the mobile phone. When a new business data type is added, the content of the custom xml file format in view of the business data type can be modified to finish the support of the novel business data type and realize the uniform receiving and sending of the wireless data transfer method of different business data.
