The invention provides a method for separating dimethyl carbonate and methanol through pressure-swing distillation of heat pump, and an apparatus thereof. In the dimethyl carbonate and methanol through pressure-swing distillation of the heat pump, an atmospheric azeotropic steam material obtained from the top of an atmospheric rectification tower is supercharged and heated by a heat pump compressor, and is introduced to a reboiler at the bottom of the atmospheric rectification tower as a heat source, so a liquid in the atmospheric rectification tower is heated, and the self-condensation of the atmospheric azeotropic steam material is completed. Compared with traditional atmospheric azeotropic steam material condensation through using cooling water and kettle liquid heating realized through an extra external heat source, the method in the invention properly improves the temperature and the pressure of an atmospheric azeotropic steam through the heat pump compressor to make the atmospheric azeotropic steam realize the kettle liquid heating and the reasonable and effective energy cycle as a heat source; and the cost generated by the pump heat compressor is far lower than the cost of traditional cooling water and the external heat source, so a good economic benefit is generated.

A system for processing materials comprises a materials-inputting system, a materials-processing apparatus connecting to the materials-inputting system and a materials-collecting system connecting to the materials-processing apparatus. The materials-inputting system comprises three or more sample chambers connecting to the materials-processing apparatus. Since there are several sample chambers, different sample chambers can be grouped in which at least one sample in one group is different from the other groups. The supply of high throughput materials to the materials-inputting system is realized by selecting different groups to connect to the materials-processing apparatus in turn. Thus, the shortcoming that the multibatchingly process can not be performed continuously in the prior materials-processing system can be overcome by the present system, thus the efficiency can be improved.

The present invention discloses a method for treating ionic liquids. In said method ionic liquids are treated by using a capillary electrophoresis technique. The advantages of using capillary electrophoresis device to study ionic liquids are the shorter separation time and the less amounts of samples. Further more, it is easier to use the capillary electrophoresis devices parallelly or combinatively. Several capillary electrophoresis devices can be combined together simply to provide hundreds or thousands of channels for separation or detection. Thus, hundreds or thousands kinds of ionic liquids can be studied simultaneously in a very short time by using a combination of capillary electrophoresis device systems.
