The invention discloses a meridian tire wire loop component and the manufacturing process thereof. Rubber base material, an anti-aging system, a reinforcement system, an adhesion system, a vulcanizing system and radio sensitizer are mixed in proportion to make a mixture. The rubber mixture is compounded in a banbury mixer. Glue is applied on a coppered steel wire based on the manufacturing technology of the tire wire loop to make the glue-coated steel wire band for meridian tire. An electron accelerator is used for producing a beam current to irradiate the glue-coated steel wire band of the meridian tire under the effect of a constant tension traction apparatus. The meridian tire wire loop component is vulcanized under the condition of luminous irradiation. After being irradiated, the crude rubber of the meridian tire wire loop component has strong Green strength and stable structural size and performance. Furthermore, steel wire withdrawal force is improved and the adhesive strength of the adhesive layer of a steel wire loop is enhanced, so the quality of a tire is improved. In addition, irradiation dose is small, the manufacturing cycle of products is shortened and production efficiency is high, thus being beneficial to environmental protection.

一种车辆用轮胎，包括胎冠，胎冠的表面设有网状的凹槽，与所述胎冠上凹槽的侧壁为倾斜侧壁，倾斜侧壁与胎冠径向之间的夹角为3°－28°。本实用新型的车辆用轮胎采用仿生设计，将胎冠上的凹槽的侧壁设计成为倾斜侧壁，倾斜侧壁与胎冠径向之间的夹角为3°－28°，当车轮滚动时，根据这一设计制造的车轮会产生一个转动中心偏离重心的力偶，并与车轮的应力在切向产生耦合效应，这一仿生设计不仅改变了传统车轮在接地点作用于车轮上的应力分布，还改变了传统的车轮转动机理，从而增加了车轮的功能，提高了车轮的工作效率。其目的在于提供一种使用寿命长，对公路路面磨损小，并可节约燃料的车辆用轮胎。
