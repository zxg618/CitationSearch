The invention discloses a synchronous recovery method and a system thereof. An encryption end and a decryption end pre-generate key seeds for the synchronous recovery. The key seeds for the synchronous recovery are different from the key seeds for the current encryption and decryption. When a trigger condition happens, the encryption end and the decryption end respectively generate a check value representing self state; if the check values generated by the two ends are not consistent, then the encryption end and the decryption end utilize the key seeds for the synchronous recovery to perform the encryption and decryption processing of the subsequent data. The method solves the problem that the keys generated by the two ends are not consistent owing to noise and the like in the encryption and decryption course, and also enhances the safety of the system by continuously updating the key seeds in the transmission course.
