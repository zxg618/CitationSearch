The method comprises the following steps: a non-networked node actively searches for and transmits a networked node of effective data through the effective data of a monitoring channel; the non-networked node actively sends a networking request to a network main node through the networked node; the network main node judges whether the non-networked node is a node recorded in a node file according to a stored node file; if the non-networked node is recorded in the node file, the network main node performs networking configuration on the non-networked node; and if the non-networked node is not recorded in the node file, the network main node counts and sorts the submitted information in the networking request of the non-networked node. The network main node is used for searching for a node which is difficult to network on a network edge, and can be used for providing information under the condition that a field practical installation terminal is not matched with a manually-entered node equipment file for correcting conveniently.
