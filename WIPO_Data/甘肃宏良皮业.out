The invention discloses a method for preparing a phosphate leather greasing agent, which comprises the following steps of: 1, taking long-chain fatty alcohol and phosphorus pentoxide in a mass ratio of 2.6-3.8: 1, reacting the long-chain fatty alcohol and the phosphorus pentoxide for 2 to 3 hours at the temperature of between 60 and 90 DEG C to obtain long-chain fatty alcohol phosphate; 2, cooling the obtained long-chain fatty alcohol phosphate, then adding low carbon alcohol into the cooled long-chain fatty alcohol phosphate, and reacting the mixture for 2 to 3 hours at the temperature of between 60 and 80 DEG C to obtain alcohol-hydrolyzed long-chain fatty alcohol phosphate; and 3, cooling the alcohol-hydrolyzed long-chain fatty alcohol phosphate, then adding an alkali compound into the cooled long-chain fatty alcohol phosphate to adjust the pH value of the long-chain fatty alcohol phosphate to between 7.0 and 7.5 so as to obtain the long-chain fatty alcohol phosphate leather greasing agent. The method for performing alcohol hydrolysis on a phosphorylation product of the long-chain fatty alcohol and the phosphorus pentoxide by adopting the low carbon alcohol improves the water emulsifying property of the greasing agent, does not produce free phosphoric acid, is favorable for environmental protection and endows the leather with durable greasing effect.

The invention relates to a preparation method of a sulfited fatty acid ester leather fatliquoring agent, which comprises the steps of reacting fatty alcohol with maleic anhydride to obtain fatty alcohol maleic acid monoesters; then, reacting long-chain fatty acid and polylol with the fatty alcohol maleic acid monoesters to obtain polyhydroxy alcohol fatty acid ester; and reacting the polyhydroxy alcohol fatty acid ester with sulfite to obtain sulfited polyhydroxy alcohol fatty acid ester which is modified with water, and preparing leather fatliquors. The preparation method has the advantages of simple process, mild reaction conditions, and no discharge of waste water, waste gas and waste slag in the synthetic process.

The invention discloses a method for preparing a polymer retanning fat-liquoring agent and the retanning fat-liquoring agent. The preparation method comprises the following steps of: preparing long-chain fatty alcohol maleic acid monoester by adopting C8-C18 long-chain fatty alcohol and maleic anhydride, preparing the long-chain fatty alcohol maleic acid monoester into long-chain fatty alcohol maleic acid monoester salt, and then dripping methacrylic acid octadecyl ester, aqueous solution of sodium methacrylate and aqueous solution of initiator into the long-chain fatty alcohol maleic acid monoester salt to perform aqueous emulsion copolymerization to form the polymer retanning fat-liquoring agent. The polymer retanning fat-liquoring agent contains terpolymer of the methacrylic acid octadecyl ester, the long-chain fatty alcohol maleic acid monoester and the methacrylic acid. The preparation method saves an organic solvent during synthesizing the retanning fat-liquoring agent so as to reduce environmental pollution, and meanwhile overcomes the defect of insufficient fat-liquoring performance of a long-chain fatty alcohol maleic acid monoester and methacrylic acid copolymer by introducing oleophilic methacrylic acid octadecyl ester monomer into the polymer.

The invention provides a method for non-bath dyeing and stuffing of leather. The process steps comprise retanning neutralization, water squeezing, dyeing and stuffing, out-of-drum and horse stacking, water squeezing, vacuum drying, hanging drying, moisture regaining, milling, surface cleaning, toggling and crush leather obtaining. In the water squeezing step, a passage water squeezing machine is used, and after the water squeezing step, the water content in wet blue leather is 35 to 40 percent. In the method, the dyeing and the stuffing are performed under a non-bath liquid condition, so that under the condition that the dyeing and stuffing effects of the leather are not lowered, the water and the energy are greatly saved; more than 5 tons of water can be saved when one ton of blue wet leather is processed, the discharge of sewage and waste water is reduced; waste water is basically not discharged in the step of dyeing and the stuffing; and thus, the production cost and the environmental protection cost are saved, and water is also saved.

The invention relaters to a production technique of semi-vegetable tanning cowhide pattern-marking upper leather, comprising the technical steps of: a, retanning by using a vegetable tanning agent; b, folding and extruding a leather billet to form patterns, fixing in a wooded frame, and then placing the leather billet and the wooded frame into a flat-bed marking device together for pattern marking; c, taking the leather billet out of the wooden frame after the pattern marking, unfolding through milling and toggling, and then manufacturing a cowhide upper pattern-marking leather product with stereoscopic patterns through coating and trimming. The invention firstly marks the patterns in the purpose-made wooded frame with certain height, the pattern-marking leather is higher than the wooded frame, and then the wooded frame and the pattern-marking leather are placed into the flat-bed marking machine together for the pattern marking so that the leather with the special patterns is obtained; in addition, the invention uses the natural vegetable tanning agent birch bark tanning extracts for retanning, is safe, environmental-friendly, light in color and beneficial to dyeing and has larger using amount, enhanced formed effect, protruded leather upper patterns, unique and natural patterns, strong stereoscopic impression and good visual effect.
