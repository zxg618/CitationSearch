The invention relates to a manufacturing method, which comprises the following steps: a. a formed steel die is assembled; b. a lower formed reinforcement cage is assembled inside the formed steel die; c. window frames and embedded parts are arranged on a bottom die of the formed steel die; d. the lower layer of concrete is subjected to casting and compacting; e. a heat-insulated board is arranged on a lower concrete board; f. an upper formed reinforcement cage is arranged inside the formed steel die, and the upper formed reinforcement cage is connected with the lower formed reinforcement cage by a galvanized iron wire; g. the upper layer of concrete is subjected to casting and compacting, and a prefabricated heat-insulated wallboard is formed; h. the prefabricated heat-insulated wallboard is subjected to vapor curing; i. the formed steel die is disassembled; j. the prefabricated heat-insulated wallboard is lifted and stacked; and k. the prefabricated heat-insulated wallboard is loaded and transported. When used, the prefabricated heat-insulated wallboard has good heat-insulating performance, superior anti-crack performance and anti-seepage performance, and can reduce on-site wet construction and improve the construction efficiency because veneer materials, doors, the window frames and prefabricated parts are subjected to casting together.
