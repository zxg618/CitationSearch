The invention belongs to the LCD stereo projection display field. At present, there are mainly two LCD stereo projection display modes: single projector mode and two-projector mode. And the natural light emitted from the projector light source is converted into partial polarized light through PCS(Polarization conversion system), and the polarized light is color-separated by dichroic mirror and then irradiates R, G and B LCD panels, respectively, and R, G and B lights are merged by X-Cube and then imaged to screen through projection objective; the polarizing states of the R, G, and B lights outputted from the X-Cube are orthogonal, and the polarizer at the outlet of the projector can not assure output of all R, G and B lights so that light energy is lost by 50%, thus affecting light energy utilization ratio and service life of stereo projector. And the invention adopts a polarization management system, making the R, G and B lights outputted from the X-Cube converted into the lights with the same polarization state, and the direction of transmission axis of linear polarizer at the outlet of the projector and the vibrating direction of incident light are the same so as to raise light energy utilization ratio.
