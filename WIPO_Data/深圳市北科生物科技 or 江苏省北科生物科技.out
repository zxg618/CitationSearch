The invention discloses freezing storage protective solution for a human umbilical Wharton's jelly tissue block. 1 liter of the freezing storage protective solution comprises 0.8 to 1.2 mol of glycol, 0.4 to 0.6 mol of dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.1 to 0.3 mol of cane sugar, 100 to 200 milliliters of cord blood autoserum and the balance of culture solution DMEM/F12. In the freezing storage protective solution, the cord blood autoserum and the culture solution DMEM/F12 serve as base solution to provide nutrient for the tissue block, so osmotic equilibrium inside and outside cells is guaranteed, the cell environment in the tissue block is guaranteed to be similar to the in vivo environment, and the freezing storage effect is good; the low-concentration glycol and dimethyl sulfoxide serve as a permeability freezing protective agent, so the toxicity of the freezing storage protective solution to the cells is reduced; and the cane sugar serves as a non-permeability freezing protective agent, so the viscosity of the solution is increased and the osmotic pressure inside and outside cell membranes is relieved when the cells are frozen and stored. The human umbilical Wharton's jelly tissue block can be directly frozen and stored by the freezing storage protective solution, so the freezing storage effect is good, the cell damage is little, and high-quality human umbilical mesenchymal stem cells can be provided for clinic.
