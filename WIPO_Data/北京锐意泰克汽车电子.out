The invention relates to a fault diagnosis method for a three-way catalytic converter of an automobile, and belongs to the technical field of automotive electronics. The method comprises the following steps of: acquiring voltage signals of an oxygen sensor in the downstream of the three-way catalytic converter in the automobile; calculating an average value N of the voltage signals in a certain period of time; calculating the difference between the current voltage signal and the average value N; calculating the difference between the current voltage signal and the average value N in a certain period of time, and calculating an average value M of absolute values of all differences; multiplying M by a coefficient K which is related to engine speed and load, and using the calculated result as an amplitude Z of the downstream oxygen sensor; respectively calculating an average value P of amplitudes of the downstream oxygen sensor in a certain period of time; and setting an amplitude threshold of the downstream oxygen sensor, and comparing P with the threshold to determine the fault condition of the three-way catalytic converter. The conversion efficiency of the three-way catalytic converter can be effectively detected by the method of the invention instead of an exhaust gas analysis device which is directly used on the automobile; and the method has the advantages of simpleness, effectiveness and low cost.

The invention relates to a method for controlling a variable-length intake manifold system of an automobile engine, and belongs to the technical field of automobile engine management. An automobile electronic control unit acquires a speed signal, an engine speed signal and an intake manifold airflow signal by using a sensor. Before the automobile engine is started, intake manifold default is in a long pipe state; after the engine is started for a certain period, a rotating speed threshold, a speed threshold, an intake flow threshold are compared with the engine speed signal, the speed signal and the intake manifold airflow signal which are used as parameters, and the long and short pipe switching of the intake manifold is circularly controlled by combining specific working conditions of the automobile engine. The long and short pipe switching of the variable-length intake manifold is controlled through an accurate algorithm, so that the actual run working conditions of the automobile engine are met, and torsion output of the engine at different rotating speeds can reach an optimal value, particularly the torsion output of the engine at low and medium rotating speeds can be improved; and the method has no adverse effect on the fuel economy and high rotating speed power so as to improve the adaptability of the engine.

The invention relates to a method for identifying top dead center of compression of cylinder 1 of automobile engine, belonging to the technical field of automobile automatic control. An automobile isstarted, an initial voltage signal of an automobile cam shaft is set into a low level signal by ECU; an engine is started, ECU collects an admission pressure signal of the engine cylinder 1 and an engine cylinder 4 to obtain the maximum value, minimum value and difference of the admission pressure, compared with the differences of the cylinder 1 and the cylinder 4, the synchronous state of the initial voltage signal of the automobile cam shaft, set by the electronic control unit, and the top dead center of compression of the cylinder 1, is determined, when the synchronous state is incorrect, the voltage signal of the cam shaft is adjusted. In the method, a camshaft position sensor is not needed, but the top dead center of compression of cylinder 1 can be identified, so as to carry out accurate synchronization of the engine and ECU and realize accurate sequence injection of fuel oil. The method can save system cost, simplify the design of the engine and obtain dual benefits of economy and technology.
