The invention discloses a sustained circulating type method for adsorbing and recycling oil gas , which consists of the following steps: (1) adsorbing and recycling the oil gas by means of an active carbon bed in an adsorption tower; (2) the desorption and regeneration of the adsorption tower saturated is carried out; (3) the oil gas desorbed with high concentration enters a recovery tower to be absorbed by the body of liquid meager gasoline; (4) the tail gas in the recovery tower reenters the adsorption tower to be cycled in a sustaining way, wherein, at least two adsorption tanks in the adsorption tower alternately carry out adsorption and desorption generation, thus leading the oil gas adsorption to be carried out in a sustained circulating way, at the same time, the remote monitoring can be realized by using an automatic control program. The sustained circulating type method for adsorbing and recycling oil gas of the invention is characterized by high efficiency, low energy consumption, convenient operation and safe and reliable running.
