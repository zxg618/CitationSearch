The invention relates to an assembled integrated house member comprising a house frame structure, an external wall assembly, a slop top plate assembly, an internal wall plate assembly and storey bearing plates, wherein the external wall assembly and the slop top plate assembly respectively comprise an outer coating faceplate, an inner coating faceplate and a packing layer between the outer coating faceplate and the inner coating faceplate, and both sides of the packing layer are provided with pressure sensitive adhesive and strippable paper. Each storey bearing plate comprises a reinforced frame body, an upper coating faceplate, a lower coating faceplate, cellular packing materials and a waterproof layer. The internal wall plate assembly comprises coating faceplates on both sides and a packing layer arranged between the coating faceplates, wherein both sides of the packing layer are provided with the pressure sensitive adhesive and the strippable paper. The members of the invention are processed in a standard way in factories, and are convenient for classification and long distance transport. The assembly parts of the external wall assembly, the slop top plate assembly and the internal wall plate assembly are separately manufactured and are installed on site. The assembled integrated house member has the advantages of orderly, easy, fast and convenient installation, low labor intensity, favorable house integrity, heat preservation, thermal insulation and sound insulation performance, environment and health protection, and energy and material saving.

The invention is concerned with production method of corrugated honeycomb with flame-retarded, fireproofing and anti-fungal function for engineering. It relates to multi-position roll putting framework having at least two layers of roller axis on paper setting rack with some corrugated web rollers with flame-retarded function set on it, leading equipment, multi-position wrapping glue equipment and each layer of it made up of upper and lower gelatinizing roller and glue spraying head corresponding to corrugated surface, multi-position drying equipment, multi- position bar cutting equipment, gathering barrier group, complex drying equipment, cutting equipment and plate spelling equipment. The complex body of corrugated honeycomb beehive disposed by flame-retarded and wrapping fireproofing glue and accords to the standard for engineering with A level non-burning stuff standard. It has multi-position with high production and high speed and effect. The erect muscle structure has high mechanics intension and resist-bending load ability, and the structure of corrugated honeycomb is orderly with good capability.
