The synthesis process of beta-isophorone trimethyl silane enol ether includes the reaction between beta-isophorone and trimethyl chlorosilane under the catalysis of sodium iodide to obtain beta-isophorone trimethyl silane enol ether. The said beta-isophorone trimethyl silane enol ether is made to produce Aldol react with crotonaldehyde, and the product is heated to dewater to produce large column trienic ketone. The present invention has the advantages of simple operation and high yield, and is suitable for industrial production. The synthesized large column trienic ketone is used in cigarette essence and has excellent effect.
