The invention relates to a device and method for changing plane images into three-dimensional videos in real time. The device mainly comprises a plane image input unit, a processing unit, a making unit and a broadcasting unit, wherein the plane image input unit completes the obtaining of the plane images, the processing unit analyzes the plane images into first image digital information, the making unit horizontally displaces the first image digital information and/or forming second image digital information after the lagged displaying of the first image digital information, and the broadcasting unit forms the three-dimensional videos through the simultaneous displaying of the first image digital information and the second image digital information. The invention also provides the method for changing the plane images into the three-dimensional videos in real time, which is matched with the device for changing the plane images into the three-dimensional videos in real time. Through the device and the method, free conversion of the plane images can be realized, and the plane images can be conveniently converted into the three-dimensional videos in real time. The switching between all function is simple and convenient, and the three-dimensional image effect is smooth.

The invention discloses a device and a method for collecting and recording three-channel three-dimensional images. The device can be applicable to conventional three-dimensional shooting and recording, microspur three-dimensional shooting and recording and common three-dimensional shooting and recording, and has the functions of automatically measuring distance and freely setting three-dimensional depth, thereby fundamentally solving the difficult problems of unsound three-dimensional shooting space and deformation. A shooting and recording mirror support of the device can also be extended out of a shell to realize horizontal 360-degree panoramic three-dimensional shooting.
