The invention discloses a method for preparing methylsufonyl chloride by using a continuous process. The method is implemented by taking methyl mercaptan as a raw material through the steps that methyl mercaptan and chlorine gas have a continuous reaction in a hydrochloric acid aqueous solution; due to hydrogen chloride gas produced in the reaction, materials produce turbulence, so that reactants flow in a piston flow and complete mixing flow combined mode in a mixed reactor consisting of a rising film reactor (shell-and-tube heat exchanger) and a complete mixing reactor, in such a way, the reactants are so as to fully contacted and reacted, heat produced in the reaction is moved away in time, and then a low reaction temperature is kept; a material produced in the reaction is sprayed, washed and absorbed by low-temperature methylsufonyl chloride after being subjected to settlement and stratification, and then a product methylsufonyl chloride and a by-product hydrogen chloride gas are separately taken out. According to the method, the reaction is performed in an airtight space, thereby avoiding the pollution to the environment, and reducing the cost.

The invention discloses a method for preparing 2,3-dichloropyridine with a simple process and a high yield rate. The method is as follows: in a concentrated hydrochloric acid, 3-aminopyridine is used as a starting material, Fe<2> or Fe <3> is used as a chlorination catalyst, and a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and hydrochloric acid or chlorine is used as a chlorating agent to conduct a chlorination reaction to chloridize the 3-aminopyridine. The reaction mixtures without being separated are added with Cu<+> or Cu<2+> which serves as a catalyst for diazotization/chlorination reaction and with an aqueous solution sodium nitrite to conduct diazotization/chlorination reaction to prepare 2,3-dichloropyridine by a one-pot process. The 2,3-dichloropyridine is isolated and purified by a normal method with a purity more than 99.2 percent. According to a 3-aminopyridine based calculation, the molar yield rate of the 2,3-dichloropyridine is more than 74.1 percent.

The invention discloses a preparation method for methane sulfonic acid. A water liquor or a solid mixture of a sulfite or a mixture of the sulfite and a bisulfite is reacted with a dimethyl sulfate to generate a methyl sulfonate and a sulfate, and the mixture liquor of the reaction directly cools and precipitates a sulfate salt crystallization through concentration by adding a salting-out agent or a concentrated liquor; filtering and removing a dilute-methyl sulfonate liquor of the sulfate; a soluble alkaline earth salt can also be reused as a precipitant for further removing the remained sulfate ion; finally, the purified methyl sulfonate liquor is concentrated to pulpiness or dry powder to be acidified by excess concentrated hydrochloric acid or excess hydrogen chloride gas is directly pumped in the purified methyl sulfonate liquor to precipitate a sodium chloride crystallization. After filtering, the mixed acid liquor of hydrochloride and methane sulfonic acid can be gotten, which can get the highly-purified methane sulfonic acid after evaporation concentration, vacuum distillation and distillation. The materials of the invention can be gotten easily and the invention has simple techniques and low cost, which does no harm to the environment and is suitable to be used in industry.
