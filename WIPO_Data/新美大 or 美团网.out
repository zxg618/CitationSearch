PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a grinding fluid injection structure of a grinding device, which achieves efficient injection of grinding fluid onto a grinding surface. SOLUTION: According to the grinding fluid injection structure, an upper wheel 2 and a lower wheel 3 are arranged such that their grinding surfaces are opposed to each other. Then a carrier 6 is pinched between the upper wheel 2 and the lower wheel 3, and the carrier 6 functions to hold a workpiece material 7 which is then ground. A base metal 4 of the upper wheel 2 has injection holes 11 penetrated therein from an outer peripheral side to an inner peripheral side thereof. Each injection hole 11 is inclined downward from the outer peripheral side to the inner peripheral side of the base metal 4, and therefore the injected grinding fluid passes through the base metal 4 of the rotating upper wheel 2 and drops to a central portion of the carrier 6. The grinding fluid flows along an outer peripheral surface of the carrier 6 according to rotation of the grinding device 1, and thus the grinding surfaces are cooled by the grinding fluid.

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a composit fire alarm apparatus which detects a fire early in a smoldering fire in which a smoke density and a CO density increase gradually, but does not operate immediately to a non-fire phenomenon in which a smoke density and a CO density increase suddenly. SOLUTION: When a smoke density in a smoke sensing part 3 reaches 2.5%/m, a microcomputer 2 of the fire alarm apparatus 1 measures the elapsed time from that point of time to the point of time when the smoke density reaches 5%/m, sets an accumulation time in inverse proportion to the measured elapsed time, sets an operating level of the smoke sensing part 3 and that of a CO sensing part 4 at the time of detection according to the elapsed time, and judges whether the operating levels are higher than preset threshold values. If the operating levels are higher than the threshold values, when this state continues until the accumulation time elapses, the microcomputer 2 discriminates a fire alarm. If the operating levels become lower than the threshold values before the accumulation time elapses, the microcomputer 2 discriminates a non-fire alarm. COPYRIGHT: (C)2006,JPO&NCIPI

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To measure the magnitude of the minute gap between the inner tube and the outer tube of a double tube. SOLUTION: An ultrasonic wave is emitted from the inside of the inner tube in a direction vertical to the inner wall of the inner tube, by using ultrasonic test equipment. The ultrasonic wave reflects at the outer wall of the inner tube and an echo is returned. Moreover, the ultrasonic wave reflects at the outer wall of the outer tube and an echo is returned. Since the ultrasonic wave is difficult to pass the gap if the gap is large, the echo from the outer wall of the outer tube becomes smaller. Accordingly, the ratio (echo intensity ratio) of the intensity of the echo from the outer wall of the outer tube with respect to the intensity of the echo from the outer wall of the inner tube is in a functional relation of becoming larger as the magnitude of the gap becomes smaller. The magnitude of a gap can be known if an echo intensity ratio is found, by forming a database of the functional relation beforehand by performing experiments or the like.

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To precisely extract a still image of a swing position effective for diagnosing a golf swing from a moving image of the golf swing. SOLUTION: A golf swing diagnosis system comprises photography means 13, 14 which take the color moving image of a golfer 11 who swings by gripping a golf club 12 with colored marks M1 to M3 on a shaft 12a thereof; and a computer 15 for capturing the taken color moving image. The computer 15 converts the color moving image into multiple still images, executes binarization for each pixel of the multiple still images by using a predetermined threshold with respect to color information, and recognizes pixels satisfying the threshold as positions of the colored marks M1 to M3 and extracts a movement of the shaft 12a by using a motion vector quantity of one of the colored marks M1 to M3 or by using a vector angle between two of the colored marks M1 to M3. Thus, the computer 15 automatically extracts check-point images to be used for the swing diagnosis. COPYRIGHT: (C)2005,JPO&NCIPI

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To reduce a voltage obtained at both ends of a smoothing capacitor in a single phase inverter without capacitor. SOLUTION: A polyphase current supply circuit includes a smoothing circuit 15 having the smoothing capacitor C connected between power source lines L1 and L2; a diode DS having an anode connected to the power source line L1; a cathode connected to one end of a resistor RS, the other end of which is connected one end of a capacitor CS, the other end of which is connected to the power source line L2. Since the capacitor CS is charged via the resistor RS in addition to the smoothing capacitor C when rush current flows, apparent capacity of the smoothing capacitor C is increased. Further, since the resistor RS exists, an abrupt increase in the current is suppressed. Therefore, the amplitude of a rectified voltage Vdc obtained at both ends of the smoothing capacitor C can be lowered as compared with the case that a series connection of the diode DS, the resistor RS and the capacitor CS is not present.
