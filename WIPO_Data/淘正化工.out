The invention provides a polycarboxylic acids water reducing agent with low air content and the preparing process thereof. The compounded polycarboxylic acids water reducing agent has low raw material price and rich resource, which provides raw materials easy to purchase for manufacturers. Simultaneously, because of increasing of drainage components, very low concrete gas content is obtained and the rigidity of the concrete is increased. The structural general formula of the water reducing agent is indicated as the diagram.
