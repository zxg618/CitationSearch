Disclosed are an electric coagulation power handle, and electric coagulation planing tools and a planing assembly. The handle comprises a handle housing (1) and a power assembly. The handle housing (1) has an interface used to connect and drive the tools (2). The handle also comprises electric coagulation handle circuitry, and the electric coagulation handle circuitry comprises an output electrode arranged inside the interface. After the tools (2) are mounted on a port, the output electrode is electrically connected to the electric coagulation tool circuitry of the tools (2). After the tools (2) are inserted, power can be directly supplied to the electric coagulation tool circuitry inside the tools (2) through arranging the output electrode on the interface of the handle, so as to make the electric coagulation work normally. At the same time, the arrangement of the electric coagulation handle circuitry does not affect the normal installation of the tools, and hence the electric coagulation planing handle is enabled to possess the functions of electric coagulation and planing at the same time. The electric coagulation planing handle can promptly stop bleeding, prevent waiting times during the operation, while avoiding a cable from being externally connected to the tool, and guarantee that the vision of the surgeon is not affected during the operation. The operation will not be inconvenienced due to the peripheral connecting base or cable connection of the electric coagulation circuitry, thereby reducing interference with the operation and decreasing the difficulty of the operation.

The energy demand of the load can be provided for independently by the battery pack (4). The discharging power of the battery pack (4) fully matches the power demand of the load. When the battery pack (4) is low in power, the generator set is controlled and turned on to work at the optimal economic energy consumption, to provide directly the load with energy, and to charge the battery pack (4) with any surplus energy. When the power level of the battery pack (4) is raised to a set value, the generator set is shut off, and energy demand is provided for by the battery pack (4), thus implementing intermittent and high efficiency operation of the generator set and uninterrupted power supply. The greater the load fluctuations and the longer the time of operating at a low load, the higher the power saving rate of the power saving system in such working conditions.
