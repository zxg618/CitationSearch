The invention discloses a method for achieving the concurrent process of buffer data accessing and loading, which comprises using two data buffer areas to store data, wherein either of the data buffer areas is in an accessing state, and the other is in a wait state, using a data loading pointer and a data visiting pointer to point for the two data buffer areas, using the data loading pointer to point for the data buffer area in the wait state when loading for buffer data, and loading buffer data, and simultaneously using the data visit pointer to point the data buffer area in the accessing state if buffer data are needed to be accessed, and accessing buffer data. Data can be accessed when loading data according to the method without influencing the accuracy of accessing data, and the speed of accessing data can be improved.
