The almoxicillin sodium and clavulanate potassium is widely and clinically used due to good curing effect and safety. The formulations of the almoxicillin sodium and clavulanate potassium are mainly oral preparations in different ratios; because of the advantages of quick response and the like, the injection preparation is deeply and clinically welcomed, but only the 5:1 injection preparation is available in the market at present; and because the clavulanate potassium ratio in the preparation is high, the penicillin anaphylaxis and the high-potassium disease are easily caused, and the preparation is relatively high in price. Because the preparation has the defects of higher process requirements, poor preparation stability, easy decoloring and degradation, and necessary storage and transport at a low temperature, the circulation and use of the medicaments are inconvenient. By changing the ratio of the almoxicillin sodium to the clavulanate potassium and improving the preparation process, the safety of the drugs is improved, the cost of the drugs is lowered and the stability of the drug preparations is improved under a condition of ensuring the curing effect; and simultaneously, because of using a special disposable injector, the conventional complex steps of dissolving and mixing are saved.
