A manufacturing process of plating copper by using aluminum-magnesium copper-plating wire comprises the following steps: arranging wire, cleaning by alkali, cleaning by water, cleaning by sulfuric acid, cleaning by water, cleaning by alkali, cleaning by water, a first time soaking zinc, cleaning by water, removing the zinc by nitric acid, cleaning by water, a second time soaking zinc, cleaning by water, cleaning by hot water, pre-plating nickel, cleaning by water, activating, acidicly plating copper, cleaning by water, carrying out the anti-oxidation treatment, cleaning by hot water, drying and taking out the wire. The manufacturing process is characterized in that the process of the first time zinc soaking is that completing the first time zinc soaking in solution with temperature of 12-27DEG C for 30-60 sec after mixing with 60 parts water, 7 parts zinc oxide, 31 parts superalkali, 2 parts potassium sodium tartrate and 0.06 parts iron trichloride. By adopting the manufacturing process of the invention, the aluminum-magnesium copper-plating wire has the double advantages that aluminium conductor has light weight and low cost, copper conductor has high conductivity and good chemical stability, wherein the specific weight of copper is about 18-19%, mean density is 2.8g/cm3, the length of aluminum-magnesium copper plating wire whose size and weight are the same with that of pure copper wire is 3.1 times than that of the pure copper wire, tensile strength is more than or equal to 210, which enables the aluminum-magnesium copper plating wire uneasily to break and improves the quality of the products.
