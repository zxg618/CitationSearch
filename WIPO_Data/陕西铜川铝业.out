一种星型卸料阀，涉及一种星型卸料阀的改进。其结构包括卸料阀壳体、卸料阀壳体上部进料管口、位于卸料阀壳体下部的下料管口、位于卸料阀壳体内的转动叶轮和带动转动叶轮的转动轴；其特征在于其在卸料阀壳体外的带动转动叶轮的转动轴的轴上固定有有一铁磁体、在设有铁磁体转动轴的下方设有一电磁计数器。本实用新型的一种星型卸料阀，在其结构上增加了电磁计数器，叶片中的粉碎料旋转卸出时，转动轴每转动一周，设于转动轴上的铁磁体与电磁计数器产生响应，通过采集电机轴上的电磁计数器数据，数据传入系统控制中的PLC，就可以方便地得出相应的卸料量，并实现对卸料量进行有效地控制。

The invention discloses a method for recycling byproducts generated in aluminum electrolysis, and relates to a method for recycling byproducts such as shell surface materials, recycled aluminum dirty materials, aluminum ash and the like in the aluminum electrolysis production process. The method is characterized by comprising the following steps of: collecting the byproducts generated in the process of electrolyzing aluminum, screening, mixing and crushing, and gathering in a storage silo; and when an anode is replaced during aluminum electrolysis, lifting materials in the silo on the ground, conveying into a feeding bin of an electrolyzer through a pipe, and automatically feeding to cover the surface of the anode. In the method for recycling the byproducts generated in aluminum electrolysis, the byproducts such as the shell surface materials, recycled aluminum dirty materials, aluminum ash and the like generated in the aluminum electrolysis process are all recycled, and problems of high cost, high labor intensity, long working hours, high thermal loss of the electrolyzer, low environmental sanitation and the like in the adding process are solved. The technical economical indexes of the system are obviously improved, and the aims of zero emission of the byproducts of the aluminum electrolysis and energy conservation and consumption reduction are fulfilled.
