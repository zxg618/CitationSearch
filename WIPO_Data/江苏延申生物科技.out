The invention relates to a method for producing and purifying a hepatitis A inactivated vaccine. The method comprises the following steps: a Vero cell is resuscitated from a work cell tank; the Vero cell is cultured by inoculation in a two to five-liter spinner bottle provided with two to five layers and used for holding culture solution for dense culture; the Vero cell is inoculated with a working seed virus seed; the virus seed is cultured until a virus multiplication peak time after being absorbed; a cell, which is cultured through the Vero cell and contains HAV virus, is obtained after being digested; and hepatitis A virus stock solution is prepared through adding phosphate buffer solution in a floating way through removing supernatant after the cell is centrifuged; after the hepatitis A virus stock solution is broken, chloroform is added, water phase on the upper layer is taken after being vibrated and centrifuged;then the phosphate buffer solution is added; rough hepatitis A virus stock solution is prepared, ultra-filtered and concentrated, purified in two steps of water column and gel column, filtered and sterilized;filtered fluid is collected into the purified hepatitis A virus stock solution to be inactivated, and then is absorbed through adjuvant to prepare the semi finished product of hepatitis A, and to obtain the hepatitis A inactivated vaccine through sub-package. The method can improve the density of the cell, enhance the output of the virus, reduce the production cost, and realize the batch production.

The invention discloses a method to mass produce flu vaccine with bioreactor, which comprises the following steps: proceeding passage adaptation on Africa green monkey kidney cell (Vero cell) with influenza virus; intensifying intrinsic appeal of influenza virus for Vero cell; fitting for Vero cell quickly; breeding the Vero cell with cell density above 10. 7deka/ml in bioreactor; seeding the influenza virus into bioreactor; adjusting various controlling parameter in the reactor; making the virus high effective breed in the reactor; proceeding continuous perfusion; harvesting virus liquid; deactivating the virus; condensing; purifying; cracking; getting the flu vaccine. This invention possesses the advantages of high antigen quantity and stable quality.
