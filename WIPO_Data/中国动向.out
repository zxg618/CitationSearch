An application method for a certificate in WAPI safety mechanism of a wireless local area network. Firstly, it gets a user name and a password to authenticate the user name and the password through the WEB authentication mode of forced PORTAL. After the success of the authentication, a terminal STA (110) can visit the Internet (140) through a wireless access point AP (120). After the terminal STA (110) obtains an IP address of an authentication server AS (160), the applied user certificate produces a private key and a public key in local, and then an application message of the produced user certificate is sent to the authentication server AS (160). The authentication server AS (160) verifies the information according to the application message of the user certificate. After the success of the authentication, a terminal user certification is produced. The installation of the user certification is started up automatically after the terminal STA (110) receives the terminal user certification.
