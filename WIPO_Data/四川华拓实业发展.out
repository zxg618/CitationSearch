The present invention relates to a technique for recovering solent and catalyst in the course of production of polyphenyl thioether and is characterized by that said invention includes the following steps: using polyhydrate sodium sulfide and p-xylene as raw material, through the processes of dehydration and polycondensation, to produce polyphenyl thioether monomer, metal halide is used as catalyst, after polycondensation reaction is completed, firstly, using carbonate to soake the filtered-out reaction residuum to make the reaction residuum undergo the process of double decomposition to obtain carbonate deposit matter and soluble salt solution, then filtering, making the filtrating richly containing NMP return to raw material treatment, and recovering the filter cake, and under the acid condition obtaining original metal halide catalyst. The recovery rate of NMP can be up to 93%, and recovery rate of the catalyst and be up to 95%.

The present invention relates to a method for controlling technological condition for producing and synthesizing polyphenyl thioether, and is characterized by that polyhydrate sodium sulfide and dichlorobenzene are used are as raw material, and through the steps of dehydration and polycondensation to produce polyphenyl thioether monomer, in low-temp. stage of polycondensation reaction and in the closed reactor in which the refined sodium sulfide is held, the NMP solution of P-DCB is continuously and slowly injected into the reactor, and the following measurers are adopted to control temp. and pressure in the reactor, and make its temp. be at 180-220 deg.c and pressure be at 4-10 kg: 1. according to the temp. change in the reactor, feedback-controlling injection rate of NMP solution of P-DCB; 2. according to the temp. change in the reaction feedback-controlling heating system to regulate temp. to make it rise; 3. according to the temp. change in the reactor feedback-controlling temp. and making it lower. Said invention can effectively control reaction speed, can prevent bumping and can make PPS product retain stable mean molecular weight.

The present invention adopts polyhydrate sodium sulfide and p-dichlorobenzene as raw material, and utilizes the processes of dehydrating sodium sulfide and polycondensation to produce polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) monomer. It is characterized by that in the course of dehydration of polyhydrate sodium sulfide the polyhydrate sodium sulfide and NMP solution are heated in reactor to produce azeotropism at 180-220 deg.C so as to make crystal water of polyhydrate sodium sulfide be carried out with vapour phase. Said invention has no need of special dehydration equipment, and the temp. rising for dehydration is identical to the temp. rising direction of next operation for adding p-dichlorobenzene to implement polycondensation reaction, so it can prevent extra energy consumption.
