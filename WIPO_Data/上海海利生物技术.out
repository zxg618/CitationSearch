Provided is a method for culturing stem cells, comprising the following steps: preparing an amnion epithelial cell feeder layer that has not been treated to arrest cell division; introducing stem cells into the amnion epithelial cell feeder layer and then culturing said cells in a culture solution. The method for culturing stem cells dose not require treating the amnion epithelial cell feeder layer to arrest cell division, therefore the method is simple and safe. The method effectively solves the problem of animal pathogens tainting human stem cell cultures, and reduces the cost of culturing stem cells. A safe, effective, and low-cost method for culturing stem cells is provided for stem cell production.

The invention relates to the technical field of biology, in particular to a stem cell culture method. The invention discloses a stem cell culture method, which comprises the following steps: preparing amnion epithelial cell nutritive layers which do not carry out fissionability deprivation treatment; and inoculating stem cells on the amnion epithelial cell nutritive layers to be cultured in a culture solution. The stem cell culture method of the invention does not need the fissionability deprivation treatment on the cells of the nutritive layers, the steps are simple, convenient and safe, the problem of animal pathogenic pollution on the human stem cell culture at present is effectively solved, the culture cost of the stem cells is greatly reduced, and the invention provides a safe, effective and cheap stem cell culture method for the industrialization of the stem cells in future.
