The invention provides a unified processing system for game props, and a processing method thereof. The system comprises one or a plurality of game servers used for running a plurality of one-line network games and generating a game prop information establishment, read or change request used across games for establishing, reading or changing the game tool information of the game account numbers stored in the corresponding character image information storage server and used across games; one or a plurality of character image information storage servers in which the game tool information used across games is stored and which are used for responding to the establishment, read or change request of the game prop information used across games in the game servers. By adopting the unified processing system, game client ends developed by different persons can be integrated quickly and conveniently, which are completely compatible with various graphic base layers; different games can be ensured to be switched quickly and continuously; when the games are switched, the control power is not returned to an operating system, thus achieving seamless switch and bringing smooth experience for players.

A three-dimensional mapping method of human faces in a computer virtual world comprises the following steps: Step 1, providing a human face photo, conducting human face feature recognition by using the computer vision technology, and acquiring human face feature data; Step 2, selecting the most matching three-dimensional human face model picture of the human face feature data in a prefabricated three-dimensional human face model picture, or generating a three-dimensional human face model picture according to the human feature data; and Step 3, combining the human face photo and the thee-dimensional human face model picture. A front three-dimensional virtual human face is rapidly and accurately generated according to the human face photo, and the human face picture is perfectly matched with the three-dimensional model. Even if a user who has no three-dimensional knowledge can create a three-dimensional role of the user himself in a short time. The method can be widely applicable to personal images or virtual characters in the virtual world, such as network interaction, web2.0, a virtual platform, communities, etc.
