The invention discloses a system for collecting and playing a mobile television signal, comprising a USB (Universal Serial Bus) main control module, an FPGA module, a memory bar, an external interface module (3) and a PC (Personal Computer). The USB main control module is used for transferring a control instruction between the PC and the FPGA module and transmitting data, the FPGA module realizes the data and information interaction between the USB main control module and the memory bar which is used for buffering the collected data, the external interface module (3) is used as a signal input interface in data collection and used as a signal output interface in data playing, and the PC is used sending the control instruction for collecting the data or playing the data to the FPGA module. In data collection, the data buffered in the memory bar is read in and stored; and in data play, the data to be played is stored in the memory bar through a USB interface of the PC. The invention also discloses a control method of the system for collecting and playing the mobile television signal. The invention can collect and play data and has simple operation, strong generalization, stable operation and self verification of data transmission accuracy.

The invention discloses a receiving antenna of mobile handheld equipment. The human body is used as a receiving antenna and a human body coupled electromagnetic field energy signal is converted into an electric signal of the mobile handheld equipment. The receiving antenna is directly connected with a direct-current short-circuit network in an input impedance matching and filtering network of the mobile handheld equipment naturally; the other end of the direct-current short-circuit network is connected with other input impedance matching and filtering networks and an inductor L1; the other end of the inductor L1 is connected with equipment reference ground; the other ends of other input impedance matching and filtering networks are connected with a receiving circuit at the rear end; the human body, the mobile handheld equipment and the ground form a system; and the direct-current potential of the human body and the direct-current potential of the ground can be same or different. The invention can effectively solve the problem of receiving performance deterioration caused by the size limit of the receiving antenna and the mismatching of the input impedance in the use process and is suitable for the common mobile handheld equipment, such as an FM radio, a mobile digital TV receiving device, and the like.

The invention discloses a conditional access system access method for machine-card separated type mobile digital TV by connecting existing memory card interface of mobile digital TV (MDTV) and conditional access system. Process in MDTV simulates different communication interfaces through GPIO to support CAS of different communication interface; GPIO interface communicating with CAS is led out from lead foot of memory card. For accomplishing machine-card separation, the invention utilizes existing memory card interface of MDTV receiving equipment to connect CAS insert card of different interfaces, simplifies MDTV reception equipment, facilitates large scale production, thereby effectively reducing costs.
