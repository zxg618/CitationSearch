The invention relates to special paper, in particular to special paper for a magnesium oxide board and a preparation method thereof. The special paper is characterized by comprising the following raw materials in percentage by weight: 30%-65% of wood pulp, 10%-50% of padding, 10%-18% of additive and 2%-15% of heat-resistant dye. The padding adopted in the invention effectively improves the coverage of the paper for the magnesium oxide board, and a good covering effect can be realized by pressing with a smaller pressure when the magnesium oxide board is processed, thereby overcoming the adverse effect resulted from the low strength of the magnesium oxide board. The additive adopted by the invention effectively improves the evenness of fiber texture and the surface printability of the paper for the magnesium oxide board, and the heat-resistant dye effectively improves the color fastness to sunlight and the color fastness to washing of the base paper, and simultaneously presents bright colors. The paper for the magnesium oxide board can be substituted for traditional finish materials such as ceramics, glass, wall paper, plastics and the like, has the characteristics of low price, simple processing, greenness, environmental protection, various bright colors and the like, simultaneously can greatly save resources, and has notable economic and social benefits.
