The present invention relates to a long-effect fragrant ink, including a color material providing the colors, a connecting material, a solvent, a dispersant and a viscosity modifier; the ink also contains a fragrance intermediate of 1 to 10 percent and a solvent which can dissolve the color material, the connecting material and the fragrance intermediate at the same time; the solvent is chosen from the hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, esters, or mineral oil. When the fragrance intermediate is exposed in the air, the fragrance intermediate can be oxidated to release the fragrance; when the fragrance intermediate is in the closed space, the oxidation is stopped because of the lack of the oxygen and the release of the fragrance is also suspended. Therefore, the book or the folding-leaf product printed with the fragrant ink can release the fragrance only when opened for reading; when book or the folding-leaf product is closed, the fragrance is weakened and finally disappears; thus the fragrance of the ink can be maintained for a longer period.
