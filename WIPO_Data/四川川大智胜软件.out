The invention provides a method for realizing a consistency function of multimachine core data in an ATC (automatic timing corrector) system. In the method, a locking mechanism is utilized to prevent data from being modified by multiple processes and multiple mainframes which operate in parallel and needs to send locking requests to other mainframes except a mainframe node by taking each Key value as a particle size, the locking mechanism forms a waiting queue before sending the requests and the requests carries logic time stamps, and each node compares the locking requests received from other mainframes to determine whether to send request responses; and the nodes sending the locking requests confirm that locks are acquired by per se and begin to send the data when checking that the waiting queue is null. During waiting for the locking waiting queue to be null, if a local machine puts forward an update request to the Key value by using the service process, then a previous update request to the same Key value is covered, which is used as compressive treatment. When a Key value needs reading by a node, the locking data is also needed to be used, thus dirty data in certain data updating cannot be read, thereby ensuring that each node and a Key value appear in a concurrent sequence.
