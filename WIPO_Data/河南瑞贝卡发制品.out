The invention relates to a hair fiber postprocessing false twisting device and method. The hair fiber postprocessing false twisting device is composed of godet wheels, a cylinder, a supporting seat, lead screws, a motor and a transmission device. The upper end and the lower end of the cylinder are fixedly connected with the lead screws, the godet wheels are arranged on the lead screws and can rotate around the lead screws in the vertical direction, and the motor drives the cylinder to rotate through the transmission device. A strand penetrates through an upper godet wheel and a lower godet wheel from bottom to top in an S shape, the motor drives the cylinder to rotate forwardly for 15 seconds to 22 seconds to twist the strand and rotate reversely for 15 seconds to 22 seconds to untwist the strand, and after the strand moves upwards for a certain distance, the twisting and untwisting steps are repeated until the movement of the strand is completed. The hair fiber postprocessing false twisting device is simple in structure, cutting and sealing time requirements when a box is full are met, and the whole false twisting process only needs 30 seconds to 45 seconds. Directions of single fibers in the strand false-twisted by the hair fiber postprocessing false twisting device can be changed, elasticity of the fibers is improved, broken filaments on the surface of the strand are reduced, and fiber wrapping caused by looseness of strands in a finished product box is avoided.

The present invention provides a tri-color production technology of chemical fiber hair for periwig, and the technology includes bundling, dyeing (discoloring), finishing, drying and etc. of chemical fiber hair. The bundling means that bundling the middle or one end of the chemical fiber hair with a plastic film and retaining a length to be colored; the dyeing means that the required dyeing materials are added into a dying channel after being weighted and combined, acetic acid, carrier and salt are added, after the water temperature reaches 60-90DEG C, the bundled chemical fiber hair is put in the dyeing channel for thermal insulation for 15-30 minutes; the discoloring means that hydrogen peroxide, ammonia water and whitening power of different concentrations are put in to the dyeing channel, with temperature rising to 85-100 DEG C, and the bundled chemical fiber hair is put into the channel for 15-20 minutes; the finishing is to put the cleaned chemical fiber hair into water added with soft oil and immerse for 10-15 minutes under the temperature of 20-30DEG C. Upon different tri-color demands, dyeing (discoloring) realizes one dyeing and one discoloring, double dyeing or double discoloring for two ends or one end for respective dyeing or discoloring, and the chemical fiber hair with the original color expresses a tri-color effect and makes the chemical fiber hair more vivid.
