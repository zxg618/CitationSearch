The invention discloses a method for controlling a direct interconnection node amount and a network entity device. The method comprises the following steps: an end server ensures a present stage according to a total amount of nodes of a client served at present and an amount range of each stage divided in advance; the end server ensures an amount of direct interconnection nodes needed to be served at present according to the present stage and an amount determination rule arranged in advance of the direct interconnection nodes of the stage; and the end server controls the amount of the served direct interconnection nodes to reach the amount of the direct interconnection nodes needed to be served at present. The invention avoids the problems in the prior CDN-P2P mixed streaming media system that a control mechanism for the amount of the direct interconnection nodes can lead the transmission and the starting of streaming media to have long time delay, as well as overweight and excessive service pressure of the end server, occupy the service bandwidth of the end server, and limit the expansibility of the system.
