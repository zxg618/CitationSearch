The invention discloses a gyroscope assisted positioning method. The method comprises the following steps: step one, measurement of attitude angle: individually subjecting a measured value of an accelerometer and a measured value of a magnetic sensor to the Gauss-Newton iteration so as to obtain an attitude error speed, obtaining an attitude quaternion speed by using a gyroscope through a quaternion differential equation, adding the attitude error speed and the attitude quaternion speed together so as to obtain an attitude quaternion; step two, obtaining an initial point: carrying out track calculation according to the data of the accelerometer and the gyroscope chip so as to improve the track period to the data period of an inert measuring unit; step three, calculating the speed and the displacement distance; step four, calculating the position point, and step five, correcting the position. The method effectively solves the problems of gyroscope drift, carrier linear acceleration and interference of the surrounding local magnets, then carries out project correction on the positioning result according to the road data, and calculates the next position point by utilizing the correction result, and thus effectively reduces the accumulated error.

The invention relates to a one-key motorcade and self-driving marshalling service system and method. The system comprises user terminals and a service center. Each user terminal comprises a terminal transmitting module, a terminal receiving module and a terminal display module. The service center comprises a center receiving module, a search positioning module and a center transmitting module. The system can be expanded to be used by a smart phone client. The method comprises the motorcade establishing step and the motorcade joining step. The motorcade step establishing step is that the one-key motorcade establishing option is clicked; a motorcade is established automatically after a motorcade establishing instruction is received by the system; motorcade information is returned, and the motorcade number and the motorcade password are displayed; and motorcade member information are displayed by the terminals. The motorcade joining step is that the one-key motorcade joining option is clicked; a service agent is called, and the service center is connected; the motorcade number and the password are provided for identity verification; after the identity verification is successful, the system is joined into the motorcade; the motorcade member information is returned to provide numbers for motorcade members; and the motorcade member information is displayed by the terminals.

The invention relates to a method for judging the road traffic state based on an annular coil of a signal lamp system. In the method, traffic historical data is acquired by using an annular coil detector and subjected to cluster analysis to obtain clustering centers corresponding to different traffic states; and a Euclidean distance between the real-time traffic data and each clustering center is directly calculated when the real-time traffic state is judged so as to judge that the current traffic state is the traffic state corresponding to the clustering center of which the Euclidean distance is the shortest.
