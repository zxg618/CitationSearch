The invention provides a method for evaluating a user. The method includes acquiring at least two attribute values of a first user, matching the attribute values with a first classification interval group, and acquiring a first classification value T1 corresponding to a successfully-matched classification interval; determining a user value of the first user according to the first classification value T1. By the method, more comprehensive evaluation on the user value can be realized, so that the method for evaluating the user is wider in application range, and a solider foundation is laid for taking specific measures later according to the user value. The invention further provides a device for evaluating the user.

The embodiment of the invention discloses a method and a device for identifying a user attribute. The method comprises the following steps: building a release interval by using limit parameters of network message limit rules; acquiring a value of a corresponding user attribute according to limit attributes of the network message limit rules; and judging whether the attribute value of the user attribute is in the release interval. If yes, the current user attribute conforms to the limit rules; otherwise, the current user attribute does not conform to the limit rules. By extracting the parameters from the limit rules to build the release interval, the method provided by the embodiment of the invention realizes uniform representation of the limit rules, so that the identification of the user attribute is not limited by a specific limit rule; the original identification process of the user attributes is not needed to change according to the limit rules; and the identification efficiency of the user attribute is improved so as to further improve the sending efficiency of network messages.

The invention embodiment discloses a network message transmission method, apparatus and system. The method comprises: receiving the identification information of the network message to be transmitted from the network message transmission server; searching for the transmission record of the network message to be transmitted according to the identification information; Wherein, the transmission record includes the transmitted times and preset transmitting times; when the transmitted times is less than the preset transmitting times, adding 1 to the transmitted times, and simultaneously instructing the network message transmission server to transmit the network message. The invention realizes to control the network message transmission times generally by network message transmission database, thereby, avoids the transmission record difference of the same network message in different network message transmission servers effectively.
