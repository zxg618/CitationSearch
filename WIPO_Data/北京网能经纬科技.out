The invention relates to a network transition architecture, and especially relates to a transition architecture for enabling to transfer from IPv4 to IPv6, characterized in that: (1) a converged gateway is arranged between IPv4 network and IPv6 network; (2) application proxy programs are installed on client ends; (3) the gradually arranged converged gateway and client proxies themselves form a network architecture of overlay network between the current IPv4 and IPv6 networks. The method of the invention, with hardly modifying the current application program and without changing the architecture of the current IPv4 network or IPv6 network itself, enables an IPv4 user to access service resources in the IPv6 network, and an IPv6 user to access service resources in the IPv4 network too. There are one or more virtual connection paths from a client end to a service resource end, and thereby the communication reliability between both is further enhanced.

The invention relates to a transitional system architecture of a network, in particular to the transitional system architecture for realizing migration from an ipv4 network to an ipv6 network, which is characterized by comprising the following steps: (1) deploying fusion gateways between the ipv 4 network and the ipv6 network; (2) installing an application proxy at a client; and (3) forming a network architecture of an overlay network between the existing IPv 4 network and the IPv6 network by the gradually deployed fusion gateways and a user agent. The method of the invention realizes that an ipv4 user can access service resource in the ipv6 network and simultaneously an ipv6 user can access the service resource in the ipv4 network almost without modifying the conventional application program or changing the conventional architecture of the ipv4 network and the ipv6 network, and provides one or more virtual connection routes between the client and the service resource so that the reliability of the communication between the ipv4 network and the ipv6 network is further enhanced.
