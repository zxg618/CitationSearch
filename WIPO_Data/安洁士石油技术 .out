The invention provides a water treatment agent with bentonite being modified by humic acid and a preparation method thereof. The preparation method is a method of preparing a novel water treatment medicament with bentonite and weathered coal being main raw materials. The method comprises the following steps: (1) grinding bentonite to a particle size between 200 meshes to 300 meshes with a bowl mill, and placing the above resultant into an ethanol solution for dispersing to a sol shape; (2) grinding weathered coal to a size between 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm, and placing weathered coal powder into a sodium hydroxide solution for a reaction for 48 hours at a temperature between 50 DEG C to 80 DEG C; (3) adding an extracted humic acid solution into the bentonite sol, followed by dispersing for 10 minutes under ultrasonic condition, subjecting the mixture to full stirring for 2 hours, carrying out accelerative drying on the mixture under 750 W microwave radiation, and grinding the resultant to obtain a finished product. According to the invention, the weathered coal is used as a raw material, and extracted humic acid is used as a modifier of the bentonite. The water treatment agent in the invention has the characteristics of low price, wide raw material source, small secondary pollution and the like, thus adsorption of organic matter is facilitated, and adsorption removal of the organic matter is reinforced.

The invention relates to an integral treatment process of the oily sewage of an oil field. The process flow in the invention is as follows: settling sand, removing oil, breaking emulsion through air flotation, treating with a microwave-enhanced Fenton system, performing flocculation and air flotation, performing precision filtering, performing catalytic ozonation with an activated carbon fiber felt, and performing ultrafiltration to obtain clean water. By adopting the integral treatment process, the operations of oil removal, emulsion breaking, advanced oxidation, flocculation, catalytic ozonation and membrane separation can be continuously realized. The floor space of equipment in the invention is small; the treatment process is suitable for various oily sewage and has obvious treatment effect; the removal rate of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of raw water is more than 96%, and the oil content and the removal rate of suspended matters are 100%; and the turbidity of the obtained water is 4-6 NTU. The main indexes of the process provided by the invention such as the COD, oil content, suspended matters, turbidity and the like are better than those of the current oily sewage treatment process in oily sewage treatment; and the quality of the treated water can meet the related rules of the Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standard (GB8978-1996) and the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002).

The invention aims to provide a device capable of on-line completion of regeneration of adsorption capacity of an activated carbon felt, which comprises a buffer storage cistern, an activated carbon felt filtering layer, a high pressure steam generator, a backwash pump and the like. After sewage water enters an activated carbon felt adsorption tank, under the action of pressure difference, the carbon felt adsorption process is completed through the activated carbon felt filtering layer and a filtering shaft, and the purified water after adsorption enters the buffer storage cistern. The high pressure steam generator is opened to fill high temperature steam into the activated carbon felt adsorption tank, and the backwash pump is opened for washing, thereby completing the regeneration process of the adsorption capacity of the activated carbon felt. The invention has the advantages of realization of on-line adsorption and regeneration of the activated carbon felt, realization of automated production, good filtering effect, high adsorption rate, high efficiency and longer service life and lower cost of the activated carbon felt.
