The invention discloses a live broadcasting time shifting system based on a P2P (peer-to-peer) technology and a method thereof. The system comprises a code server, a live broadcasting sever and a control server which are arranged at a server side. The method comprises the following steps of: cutting live broadcasting video data received into live broadcasting video data packets with fixed size by the code server, and then adding live broadcasting channel information and time information into each live broadcasting video data packet, distributing the coded live broadcasting video data packets to the live broadcasting server, and sending the current control information to the control sever; continuously acquiring the live broadcasting video data packets from the code server by the live broadcasting video sever; when a client side applies for watching videos, firstly sending a video request to the control server, returning the storage information of the video data to the client side by the control sever, and acquiring the video data through the established data chain path by the client side. The server side and the client side of the invention can simultaneously support the live broadcasting time shifting function based on the P2P technology and support the large-scale concurrent application.
