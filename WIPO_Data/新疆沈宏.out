The invention discloses a method for producing sodium chromate by roasting chromium ore and a small amount of soda. The method is characterized in that chromium ore and calcined soda are mixed, wherein the added quantity of the calcined soda is 35% to 45% of theoretical required amount for complete reaction with dichromium trioxide in the chromium ore; then the mixture is added to a rotary kiln for first roasting, the temperature of materials at a hot space in the kiln is 1000 DEG C to 1050 DEG C, wrought materials are cooled and leached to obtain a sodium chromate leaching solution and first chromium dregs; the first chromium dregs are dried and crashed for second roasting with newly added calcined soda, the use amount of the calcined soda is 30% to 50% of theoretical required amount for complete reaction with the dichromium trioxide in the first chromium dregs; the sodium chromate leaching solution and second chromium dregs can be obtained through roasting and leaching processes, the second chromium dregs, limestone and newly added calcined soda are roasted for the third time, the use amount of the calcined soda in the third roasting is 35% to 75% of theoretical required amount for complete reaction with the dichromium trioxide in the second chromium dregs, and the use amount of the limestone is 2% to 5% of the sum of weight of three raw materials of the second chromium dregs, the calcined soda and the limestone; and the sodium chromate leaching solution and third chromium dregs are obtained after leaching. By adopting method of the invention, the utility ratio of the calcined soda is also enhanced greatly.

The invention discloses a method for electrolytic production of high purity chromium metals, wherein, chromic anhydride and concentrated sulfuric acids are mixed into electrolytes according to a certain proportion which are thrown into a liquid receiving tank and then cooled by an acid-proof pump through a super stainless steel plate heat exchanger, and cooling water is provided by a steam lithium bromide refrigerating machine; the electrolytes after cooling are thrown into an electrolytic cell, pass through a liquid separation device in the cell and uniformly arrive between cathode plates and anode plates for electrolytic reaction; the electrolytes after electrolysis flow into the liquid receiving tank from an overflow weir of the electrolytic cell, and then the circulation is repeated to and fro. After the thickness of chromium plates reaches 1 to 2 millimeters through electrolysis of 24 hours or so, the cathode plates of the electrolytic cell are entirely moved out by a hanger frame through a pole plate switching device under the condition of no power failure, and then the electrolytic reaction is continued after replacement of a set of novel cathode plates. The chromium plates are knocked off manually from the replaced cathode plates, and the content of chromium can reach 99.99 percent after third-stage countercurrent washing and drying through a vibrated fluidized bed. The method reduces the cost and improves the production efficiency.
