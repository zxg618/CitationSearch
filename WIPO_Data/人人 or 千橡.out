A laser device using a solid-state laser material and an active Q-switch is reduced in size. In a laser device that uses a solid-state laser material and a Q-switch, a feature is present whereby the Q-switch is actively controlled using an electro-optic effect or an acousto-optic effect, but the laser device is increased in size. Reduced dimensions can be achieved when a magneto-optic effect is used for the Q-switch. A pulse laser can be obtained having a short duration and high peak intensity. By combining a permanent magnet and a coil, it is possible to reduce the current value for varying the Q-value.

本发明提出了一种面向软件定义网络的两阶段大流测量方法，该方法通过将sFlow采样技术与OpenFlow流表测量技术相结合，构建一种两阶段大流测量模型。该方法的基本思想是：第一阶段基于sFlow采样机制粗粒度筛选疑似大流；第二阶段由SDN控制器根据疑似大流集合信息生成相应测量规则，并向OpenFlow交换机加载测量流表项开启大流测量任务，随后读取测量流表项获取这些疑似大流的准确流量信息，从而找出真正的大流。本发明具有消除了采样率对测量精度的影响、降低了测量对TCAM资源的消耗、以及实现了交换机之间的测量负载均衡等优点。
