The present invention relates to a method for the continuous preparation of high bulk density methionine crystals. The process of the method is as follows: a hydrolysate, which is obtained from a reaction of 5-(β-methylthioethyl)hydantoin and a potassium carbonate solution, is mixed with an external circulation material from a DTB neutralization crystallizer having a gas phase neutralization section; after the mixture is cooled, the mixture enters a liquid distributor of a neutralization region in the upper part of the crystallizer; the mixture is sprayed in liquid droplets or trickles into carbon dioxide gas for neutralization reaction, and then naturally falls into a crystallization region in the lower part to be mixed with a material in the region; the mixture grows on small crystals in a system to form crystals having larger particle diameters, and meanwhile new crystal nucleuses are formed; in a settling region in the middle part of the crystallization region, the crystals having larger particle diameters sink into an elutriation leg, while the small crystals circulate with the external circulation material, and a part of the external circulation material is used for elutriating the crystals in the elutriation leg, and another part of the same is used for mixing with the hydrolysate; and the crystals in the elutriation leg are separated, washed and dried to obtain the high bulk density methionine product.

本发明公开了一种由7-对甲苯磺酰腙-3-胆固醇酯制备7-去氢胆固醇酯的方法。目前的一种方法，胆固醇经酯化、氧化、腙化、脱腙并水解得到7-去氢胆固醇，其中的脱腙反应，是典型的非均相反应，反应只在碱试剂固体表面进行，由此带来反应选择性及产品收率不高，从而导致生产成本高。本发明的特征在于，所述的脱腙反应采用聚苯乙烯树脂支载的冠醚相转移催化剂。本发明使非均相反应成为一种均相反应，能够显著提高反应选择性及转化率，提高产品质量的同时生产成本更低。同时，经过修饰固载后的冠醚，可以反复进行套用，从而避免了普通冠醚对环境的毒性。

The invention discloses a preparation method of a 5, 6-dihydrogen-pyran and the derivatives of the 5, 6-dihydrogen-pyran. In the present methods, the self-polymerization of conjugate dienes is easily happened in a synthesis reaction, and as a result, the yield rate of products is low. In the invention, under the catalysis of lewis acid, the conjugate dienes and anhydrous formaldehyde synthesize the 5, 6-dihydrogen-pyran and the derivatives by the Diels-Alder reaction; the invention is characterized in that, after being depolymerized by paraformaldehyde, trioxymethylene or polyoxymethylene in another reaction kettle, the anhydrous formaldehyde in the form of gas enters into the reaction kettle of synthesis reaction which is carried out under the temperature between 30 DEG C and 100 DEG C. Because the invention separates the depolymerization from the synthesis, the synthesis reaction does not have to be carried out under a high temperature, the self-polymerization of conjugate dienes is avoided, and therefore the yield rate of reaction is increased.
