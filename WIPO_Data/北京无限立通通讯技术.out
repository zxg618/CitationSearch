The invention discloses a method and a device for mass file access. The method comprises the following steps: obtaining a user name, conducting code computation to the user name and obtaining an integer sequence corresponding to the user name; dividing the integer sequence into two parts, wherein one part is used as a primary directory, the other part is used as a secondary directory of the primary directory and the user name is used as a tertiary directory under the secondary directory; and accessing user data corresponding to the user name under the tertiary directory. By adopting the embodiment of the invention, through the integer sequence corresponding to the user name, the user data can be evenly distributed in a plurality of directories. Moreover, through adopting a multilevel storage method, the user data under each directory is reduced. Thereby, the invention has the advantages that the mass data is supported and the access efficiency is improved.

A mailbox address with specific domain name in a mail server is assigned for a handset user. When an E-mail arrives, the Push mail gateway server sends a notice message to the mobile terminal device. With said notice message received, the mobile terminal device through mobile IP network connects the Push mail station to get the E-mail. The mobile terminal uses the commands in the mail access protocol to log on, define, receive and send mails by using the Push mail gateway. Transmitting a mail is to put the mail in a XML file, and then send it through TCP connection. The advantages of the invention are that uses can use own handset terminal to receive E-mail, read the E-mail and related attachment.

The method assigns a domain name for handset users by using a main server. Push mail gateway server through MNAP interface protocol fetches mails new arrived on the user's account. With being compressed, the said new mails are sent to the user's mobile terminal device in short message format. The mobile terminal device sends mail to be delivered in SEED format to the Push mail gateway server. Then, the mails through MNAP protocol are sent to a sending out queue of the mail server. When a short message in SEED format is arrived, the mobile terminal device decompresses the combined short message into original mail. The invention possesses the advantages of real time mobile E-mail, letting users know whether a mail is arrived or not immediately. Thus, users will not waste time and memory to log online when no new mail is arrived.
