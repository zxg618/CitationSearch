Disclosed is a composition capable of being biodegraded by soil burying, comprising polylactic acid and a polyhydroxyalkanoate, wherein the polyhydroxyalkanoate accounts for 20% to 90% based on the mass fraction of the composition. The polyhydroxyalkanoate is poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate), wherein the component of the monomer unit 4-hydroxybutyrate accounts for 5% to 20% based on the mass fraction of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate), and the weight average molecular weight of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) is in the range of 300,000 to 400,000, and the degree of crystallization is in the range of 43% to 53%. When the composition of the present invention is degraded in a soil burying environment, microorganisms first erode the surface of PHA, and then enzymes secreted by the microorganisms exert an effect on an ester bond in the polyhydroxyalkanoate and break down the ester bond, thereby destructing the structure regularity of the entire crystal, and reducing the intermolecular force. Therefore, the microorganisms can easily attack or cut off the molecular chain, thereby significantly improving the decomposition rate of the composition. More importantly, the composition needs not to be composted, and can be completely decomposed quickly in the soil burying environment.
