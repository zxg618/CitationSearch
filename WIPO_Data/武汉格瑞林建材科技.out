The invention provides an upper-flow-regime micro-expanding highway bridge post-tensioning porelike grouting agent and a preparation method of the upper-flow-regime micro-expanding highway bridge post-tensioning porelike grouting agent. The grouting agent comprises a superfine mineral admixture, an expanding agent, a polycarboxylate superplasticizer powder, a plastic expanding agent, an anti-settling agent, a redispersible rubber powder, a retarder, a defoamer and an air entraining agent, and the targets of low water-binder ratio (0.26-0.28), high fluidity (the initial fluidity is not more than 17s), zero bleeding (the free bleeding rate is 0% within 24 hours), early expanding (the free expanding rate is 0-2% within 3 hours) of a grouting material are achieved after the grouting agent is doped. A slurry layer is not layered or does not bleed, expands slightly, and is good in filling degree and volume stability at the low temperature, so that the quality reliability and durability of post-tensioning prestressed porelike grouting agent can be comprehensively improved. The post-tensioning prestressed concrete porelike grouting agent completely meets the requirements in the Technical Specifications for Construction of Highway Bridges and Culverts (JTG/TF50-2011).

The invention relates to the design and synthesis of a poly carboxylic acid water reducing agent, the coagulating time of which can be controlled. The poly carboxylic acid water reducing agent is prepared by co-polymerize the following three monomers in water: the monomer a occupying 30 to 70 percent and indicated by a general expression 1, the monomer b occupying 10 to 50 percent and indicated by the general expression 2, and the monomer c occupying 10 to 40 percent and indicated by the general expression 3. The coagulating time is controlled by the monomer a which is made by condensing maleic anhydride and polyoxyethylene monoalkyl ether. The length of a polyoxyethylene monoalkyl ether chain controls the change of the coagulating time: the longer the chain, the shorter the coagulating time is; and the shorter the chain is, the longer the coagulating time is. The monomer a does not contain inhibitive substances in the process of synthesis, therefore, the water reducing agent is easy to be controlled in the coagulating process. The poly carboxylic acid water reducing agent is suitable for the construction of concrete under different temperature conditions: under higher temperature, the water reducing agent with longer coagulating time can be adopted, and under lower temperature, the water reducing agent with shorter coagulating time can be adopted. The poly carboxylic acid water reducing agent has good adaptability to cement and admixtures and has the advantages of low mixing quantity, good slump constant hold facility and water segregation resistance, and the like.
