The invention relates to the compression technology of an audio signal. The audio signal is decomposed into a frame with a length of L; a frame sequence obtained by decomposing is sent to a signal type judging unit; the current frame sequence is sent to a psychoacoustic analytical unit and a pseudo-wavelet filter unit corresponding to the type signal in parallel; pseudo-wavelet factors are organized according to a subband sequence and are divided into scale factor bands according to the time-frequency property of the pseudo-wavelet factors; the reorganized pseudo-wavelet factors are subjected to companding treatment; the pseudo-wavelet factors subjected to the companding treatment are sent to a quantizing unit of which the whole perception distortion is the minimum; and the quantizing result is input to an adaptive Huffmam encoder to perform entropy coding to form an audio compression code stream. The pseudo-wavelet filter can realize seamless connection from the wave filtration of a slowly varying signal to the wave filtration of a quickly varying signal and from the wave filtration of the quickly varying signal to the wave filtration of the slowly varying signal in real time. The compression algorithm of the invention can realize compression ratio-variable compression of the audio signal so as to flexibly decrease the size of an audio file.

The invention relates to a Web application program copyright calibration method realized based on a universal search engine, which is suitable for the copyright checking work of a Web application program. By utilizing the method, a universal search engine function can be utilized to check whether the Web application program is unauthorized to be used or not. The key point of the invention lies in that copyright key words are set in the Web page of the Web application program which needs copyright protection, and a small program is set in the Web page to ensure that users can not change the copyright key words, and thereby, the copyright key words set in the Web page can be retrieved by the search function of the search engine, thereby retrieving copyright information. The invention can provide a simple and effective method for ensuring that the Web application program is not used under the unauthorized condition.
