A rod positioning tool mounts in series between a tubing string and the stuffing box of a drive head. An outer mandrel of the tool mounts to a first flange at the bottom end for connection to the tubing string below and an inner mandral mounts to a second flange for connection to the stuffing box above. The inner mandrel is slidably received within the outer mandrel with primary seals therebetween to vary the overall length of the tool using one or more actuators between the flanges, while maintaining a sealed connection between the tubing string and the stuffing box. Keys on the outer tubular mandrel are longitudinally slidable in keyways on the inner tubular mandrel to resist relative rotation between the mandrels. A secondary seal provides a sealed connection between the second flange and the top end of the outer mandrel in a fully retracted position of the tool.

This invention clearly identifies the current agriculture-based diseases facing United States citizens such as, heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and other degenerative diseases that did not exist in our hunter-gatherer ancestors. The United States government has established the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) to solve the problem. The DGAC's approach includes exercise, better agricultural based food choices plus vitamins-mineral supplements that are sex and age adjusted. We designed supplement compositions composed of unmodified dried fruits, herbs, including roots and tubers, many of which contain a lot of phytoestrogens. Currently, the medical profession has a bias against phytoestrogens, based on science that we believe is incorrectly interpreted. Today, women are afraid of getting breast cancer, and men are afraid of getting enlarged breasts from phytoestrogens. We will reinterpret the pre-clinical medical studies to alleviate these accepted concerns. Our supplement ingredients are chosen based on the different apoptosis pathways, which they stimulate, modulate or inhibit.

I have invented a means for keeping an occupant's head upright in a child safety seat or wheelchair. The invention comprises either a child safety seat or wheelchair with a backrest and a headrest with either loop or hook attachment media attached to the area of the headrest that contacts the back of the occupant's head (or, alternatively, in the head area of the backrest, with the headrest being omitted), with mating media attached to the backside of a cap to be worn on the head of the occupant. The occupant's head is held up by the mating of the attachment media between the cap and headrest or backrest. The purpose of this configuration is to prevent the occupant's head from tipping forward or to either side. When used in conjunction with a child safety seat, an additional purpose is to reduce injury values, such as HIC (Head Injury Criteria), neck injury, and Chest G values associated with the US Code Title 49, Part 571, FMVSS 213 performance requirements. In addition, the present invention is applicable to children and adults in other types of durable medical equipment such as standers and walkers.

Core drill bits with extended matrix heights are described. The core drill bits have a series of slots or openings that are not located at the tip of the cutting portion and are therefore enclosed in the body of the matrix. The slots may be staggered and/or stepped throughout the matrix. As the matrix of the drill bit erodes through normal use, the fluid/debris notches at the tip of the bit are eliminated. As the erosion progresses, the slots become exposed and then they function at the proximal face of the bit as fluid/debris ways. This configuration allows the matrix height to be extended and lengthened without substantially reducing the structural integrity of the drill bit. With an extended matrix height, the drill bit can last longer and require less tripping in and out of the borehole to replace the drill bit.

The invention relates to a test to detect mutations associated with antiretroviral drug resistance in HIV-1 using an allele-specific real-time PCR assay. The method uses mutation- specific PCR primers designed to detect and quantify the subset of HIV-1 viruses carrying the nucleic acid changes which are associated with cause resistance. The invention provides primers, primer sets, and amplification conditions which offer increased sensitivity of detection, after having designed and tested many different primers, primer sets, and PCR conditions. In addition, the method of the invention can be used to estimate the relative proportion of resistant viruses in the total virus population in a host. This method is therefore suited for the detection and quantification of enfuvirtide, protease, and reverse transcriptase resistance mutations in HIV-1 and will provide more useful clinical information for patient management.

Vertical field emission devices are described with very small cathode to anode separations. Preferred cathodes have sharp edge emitters extending, outward perpendicular to the surface of the underlying substrate. These sharp edge emitters are produced within planar photolithography by coating sacrificial conformal walls and anisotropic etching. Microencapsulation is used to produce a sealed cavity at low pressure which includes the space between the anode and cathode. The field emission components can be adapted for the production of light emitting, field emission diodes. The individual cathode emitters can be integrated with solid state components on the substrate with each cathode being independently addressable. Arrays of closely packed light emitting, field emission diodes of the present invention are particularly suitable for use in displays. These displays would be useful for flat-panel computer displays and high definition television.

1,020,376. Loading refuse vehicles. M. CLAR, A. SHAYNE, W. SHAYNE, and P. E. SHAYNE. July 14, 1964, No. 29021/64. Heading B8E. A front loading refuse vehicle has a chassis 10, cab 12 and body 14 having a top opening 20 and conventional compacting means 22. The loader 24 comprises booms 28 pivoted to the vehicle at 30, adjacent the top rear of the cab 12, and lifting arms 38 mounting container engaging arms 54 and pivoted to the booms at 42. The booms can be raised by a hydraulic cylinder 64 and the arms 54 can be rotated relative to the lifting arms 38, to dump the contents of a container 26, by a hydraulic cylinder 58. The booms 28 and lifting arms 38 are interconnected by crank arms 70 and links 72 so that the container follows a predetermined path and the contents are not spilled. In the dumping position C the booms and arms 28, 38 become folded together and means may be provided to latch them together so that they move together when the booms 28 are pivoted to a stored position over the cab 12 the link pivot 74 being released to pivot with a plate 34 about the pivot 30. The various latch devices may have interlocking means. The arms 54 engage container sleeves 56 loosely so that as the container 26 reaches a dumping position it drops jogging out the contents. A box member 50 provides a back support for the container 26 during lifting and dumping.
