The invention has the advantages that: the lattice distorsion of the polycrystal powder, caused by the mismatching of the larger atom radius, between the III group element and rare earth element is improved by introducing the substitutional dopant to replace the traditional III group element in the polycrystal powder to form the substitutional defect, thereby improving the luminous performance of the powder.

The invention relates to a light-emitting diode (LED) which comprises an N-shaped semiconductor layer, a P-shaped semiconductor layer and a light-emitting layer clamped between the N-shaped semiconductor layer and the P-shaped semiconductor layer. The LED also comprises an optical exciting layer, wherein the optical exciting layer comprises an III-V family compound semiconductor material doped with a rare earth element. The invention further provides a growing method of the LED. The invention has the advantages that the semiconductor material doped with the rare earth element is used as the optical exciting layer to replace the prior fluorescent powder, and the thickness of the optical exciting layer is larger than 10 microns so as to ensure that the strength of exciting light is enough to match the strength of the radiating light of the light-emitting layer and prevent mixed white light from generating color offset. The optical exciting layer can not generate an attenuation phenomenon under the condition of long-time working.

The invention relates to a growing method of a semiconductor substrate, which comprises the following steps: providing a support substrate; providing a first reacting gas containing an III family element and a halogen family element; providing a second reacting gas containing a rare-earth element and a halogen family element; providing a third reacting gas containing a V family element; mixing the first reacting gas, the second reacting gas and the third reacting gas; heating the support substrate and leading the mixed gas to pass through the surface of the heated support substrate, thereby forming a semiconductor layer, wherein the thickness of the semiconductor layer is not small than 20 microns. Because the three gases are premixed before growth, III family atoms and rare-earth element atoms can be fully diffused, and the rare-earth element atoms are uniformly distributed in the semiconductor layer. The adopted III family reacting gases containing the halogen family element can improve the concentration of the III family element in the reacting gases so as to improve the depositing speed of the semiconductor layer and further achieve high growing speed.

The invention provides a method which separates an epitaxial layer and a substrate, comprising the following steps of: (a) providing a substrate; (b) growing an inserting layer on the substrate surface, with the growth temperature of T1; (c) growing an epitaxial layer at the side of the inserting layer which is far from the substrate, with the growth temperature of T2 which is more than T1, and more than the lower temperate between the decomposition temperature for the material of the inserting layer and the temperature when separation occurs; (d) reducing the temperature to the room temperature. The invention has the advantages that when the temperature of the epitaxial layer is more than the lower temperate between the decomposition temperature for the material of the inserting layer and the temperature when separation occurs, the inserting layer forms a pore structure or generates separation in the process of growing the epitaxial layer; and in the process that the high temperature is reduced to the room temperature, the thermal stress between the substrate material and the epitaxial material is used for realizing automatic separation of the substrate and the epitaxial layer. The technical proposal does not need extra preparation process, including lithography, exposure, and etching and other complex processes, and does not need high-energy laser, thereby avoiding the impact of thermal effect.
