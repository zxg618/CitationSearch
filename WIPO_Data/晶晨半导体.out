本发明涉及DTMB技术领域，尤其涉及一种解决DTMB单载波正反频谱的搜索装置，将用于计算对数似然比(log‑likelihood ratio，llr)的对数似然比计算模块挪到时域解交织模块后，这样每解一帧低密度奇偶校验码(Low‑Density Parity‑Check Code，LDPC)时，可以将x和y进行交换(相当于正、反频谱切换)，再计算llr，最后根据ldpc解出的结果，就可以确定当前信号的正、反频谱特性，而不需要重新复位整个解调器系统，这样可大大缩短搜索时间，比通常做法可缩短约一半时间左右，减少了漏台概率；同时基于浮点二进制量化方法，可减少ram的存储。

The present invention relates to the field of televisions. Provided is a split-type television. A main control module and a display of a television are independently arranged. The display is mainly used for audio/video data playback and play control. The main control module is mainly used for receiving and processing the audio/video data of the television. The main control module and the display are independently arranged in the physical structure, so a user can separately carry out operations such as repair, maintenance, upgrade and replacement on the main control module and the display. The display (that is, the screen end) is provided with a power adapter of the main control module, so as long as the main control module is connected to the display, the main control module can be normally powered on. Therefore, the main control module and the display that are separately arranged can share one power supply, which prevents increase of the cost due to separate arrangement of power supply devices for the display and the main control module, and facilitates the arrangement and operation of the television bought by the user.
