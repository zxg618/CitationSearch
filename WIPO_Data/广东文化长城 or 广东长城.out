A fully organic macromolecular material ankle joint prosthesis comprises a talar dome prosthesis (1), a medial malleolar pad (2), and an angle bone prosthesis (3). The talar dome prosthesis is connected to the medial malleolar pad, and the medial malleolar pad is connected to the angle bone prosthesis. Both the talar dome prosthesis and the angle bone prosthesis comprise polyether ether ketone (PEEK) or a derivative thereof. The medial malleolar pad comprises ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). An implant component of the prosthesis comprises a macromolecular material, reducing an allergy and toxicity resulting from a metal and metal corrosion. An elastic modulus of a PEEK material allows the PEEK material to match with a real bone, mitigating a stress shielding effect. Further, a sliding friction surface of the prosthesis with respect to an articular cartilage reduces a wearing problem.
