The invention discloses a method for quick two-sided filtering for a video image, which is realized by decomposing a filter sliding window into a plurality of overlapped constant space filtering planes, while simultaneously carrying out histogram statistics of pixel density values for each constant space filtering plane, and processing a pixel value domain filtering by conventional weighted sum based on a histogram statistic result. As per-pixel computation for filtering kernel coefficient on the pixel value domain is not necessary, the filter processing time complexity is remarkably reduced. Based on accumulated histogram computation, a histogram of the sliding window is updated by a per-pixel scanning mode, rather than constructing an independent histogram for each filter processing pixel, thus avoiding complexity of statistical calculation for large amount of histograms.

The invention relates to a time-space domain multi-field related de-interlacing technology, which is convenient to realize by hardware. The invention provides a de-interlacing method with time-space domain information based on a movement adaptive algorithm. Different from moving state directed by an ordinary movement adaptive algorithm, that is field-in interpolation, the invention still searches for related points in a small scale of adjacent fields when it judges that it is in the moving state. It further determines specific interpolation method of next step by comparison with a predetermined value. The predetermined value ensures inter-field direction correlation of current field enough, which makes inter-field pixel points with large direction correlation participate interpolation calculation. It consumes less hardware resources compared with various search algorithms of movement compensation and is added with time domain information compared with movement adaptation, which makes the interpolation result in movement condition have time continuity. It uses peripheral point information to calculate, which overcomes effect of noise to mono-point operation and improves movement interpolation accuracy.

The present invention discloses a method for controlling B-frame code rate. In the video coding process, when the B frame in the video image group is coded, a quantified parameter threshold TQP is firstly set, and then the quantified parameter difference DQP used for I frame and P frame or two continuous P frame is calculated. Then comparison between quantified parameter threshold TQP and quantified parameter difference DQP is executed. If the absolute value of quantified parameter difference DQP is less than quantified parameter threshold TQP, a QP calculation method which guarantees the smoothness of video quality is adopted for calculating the B-frame quantified parameter BQP. If the absolute value of quantified parameter difference DQP is larger than quantified parameter threshold TQP, a QP calculation method which guarantees the smooth capability of data in the buffer area is adopted for calculating the B-frame quantified parameter BQP. Thus the QP calculating method which guarantees the smooth video quality is adopted when the variation of QP of P frame is smooth. The QP calculating method which guarantees the smoothness of data capability in the buffer area is adopted when variation of QP of P frame is furious. Thus a better compromise is realized between the smoothness of video quality at the decoding end and the smoothness of data capacity of buffer area at the encoding end.

The invention relates to video processing technology. The technical problem to be solved is to provide a field interpolation method for determining interpolation direction by considering more angle pixel correlations and eliminating isolated point noise. The reference angle of the invention picks up nine directions, namely four small angle directions and five adjacent directions. If a small angle is chosen for interpolation in certain areas with small pixel correlation difference, noise points can be introduced to the area. Therefore, as long as the pixel correlation in adjacent directions achieves a first preset value, the small angle factor can not be considered to interpolate in the largest pixel correlation in five adjacent directions. If the small angle is considered, whether the pixel correlation of the supplementary angle of the small angle is smaller than a second preset value is determined, if yes, the small angle is selected; and if not, the largest pixel correlation direction in the five adjacent directions is chosen for interpolation. The method can acquire results of smooth edges and flicker-free details.

The invention belongs to video encoding technology, in particular to an interframe fractional order movement searching method of H.264. The invention solves the technical problem that a selection method of a macro partition mode can rapidly partition a macro block in the movement searching. The selection method of the macro partition mode in the movement searching uses a threshold valve to judge SAD value of a partitioned block, thus judging matching degree of a block in the current mode; if the partitioned block has higher matching degree in the current mode, other modal partitions are not carried out on the partitioned block so as to reduce quantity of selection of the macro block partition mode; if the partitioned block has lower matching degree in the current mode, other modal partitions are carried out on the partitioned blocked so as to guarantee interframe precision of prediction. The invention can effectively reduce quantity of selection of the macro block partition selection mode and movement searching times of the block, thus improving arithmetic speed of an encoder.

The invention provides an intraframe mode selecting method that can raise the coding speed by a relatively wide margin when signal-to-noise ratio is ensured. The fast intraframe mode selecting method comprises the steps as follows: first, whether the distortion value of an MPM mode is less than or equal to a first threshold T1 is judged; if yes, the optimal predictive mode of a current block is the MPM mode; if not, the selection range of the predictive mode is gradually narrowed according to a second threshold T2 and the directivity of the predictive mode. The invention takes the directivity of the predictive mode into full consideration, and at the same time, the selection of the threshold meets the distribution characteristics of the distortion value of different modes, thus controlling the mode selection process well. Compared with traversal algorithm, the method of the invention raises the coding speed by a relatively wide margin, with the signal-to-noise ratio being hardly reduced, and is suitable for improving the H.264 coding method.
