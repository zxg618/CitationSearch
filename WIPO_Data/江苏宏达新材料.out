The invention relates to a method for preparing silicon rubber, employing dynamic high-temperature processing and programmed temperature controlling means, particularly employing revolving furnace with evacuation or stirring still drying equipment with evacuation, which shortens the aluminum hydroxide dewatering processing time dramatically and can avoid the birdnesting phenomenon in aluminium hydroxide powder, saving the process of rolling or sifting, and can be directly used as the fire retarding addictive for silicon rubber. The invention shortens the process cycle for more than half of the time, saves energy for 50~60% and improves the bulk additive dispersibility in the glue stock, and the physical-mechanical properties of the sulfide test block is also improved.

The invention relates to a method for preparing organosilicon high-temperature glue, comprising ventilating nitrogen through the bottom pipe and steam through steam coil to increase temperature directly; dehydrating the mixing methyl in the stock, the favorable improvement of the dehydrating effect of this invention compared with previous technique is that after the dehydrating the micro-hydration in stock decreases dramatically, at an average of below 10ppm. The addition quantity of regent for head closure in the polymerization process preparing high-temperature glue gradually becomes stable, the molecular weight of raw rubber polymerization is relatively stable. The quantity of terminal hydroxyl group decreases dramatically in the high-temperature glue preparing process, the moulding is faster in the process, the storing time of the mixed glue and its physical-mechanical properties and processing property have been improved considerably.
