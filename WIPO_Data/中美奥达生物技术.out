The invention provides a cell strain. An original host CHO cell strain is in an adherent and low-density state and a culture medium contains ten percent of fetal calf serum. Replacing the culture medium of the original host CHO cell strain and conducting suspension state acclimatization to obtain a host CHO cell strain which can adapt to a high-density suspension state without serum and can be used for expressing various recombinant proteins.

The invention provides a method for rapidly constructing a high-density suspension cell strain; original cell strain is in an adherent and low-density state and adapts to growing in an environment with serum medium. Acclimatization is so performed that the original cell strain can adapt to the suspension state: transplanting the original cell strain in a square bottle and replacing culture medium, conducting passage when the cell grows to a log phase, continuing passage so that the cell adapts to the new environment in the square bottle, shaking the bottle and continuing passage to make the cell adapt to the suspension status gradually so as to obtain a cell strain adapting to a high-density suspension state without serum.

The invention provides a CHO cell strain which can express HBV surface antigen for vaccine stably and efficiently. A CHO cell strain which can express hepatitis B surface antigen stably and efficiently is obtained by adopting the method of pore plate screening and gene expansion screening the CHO cell strain which can express against Epitope of HBV already.
