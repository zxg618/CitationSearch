A production method of the diisobutylthiuram disulfide-accelerant of the vulcanization of rubber is provided, which is the production method of the accelerant of the vulcanization of rubber. The method overcomes the defects existing when others produce the product. The raw materials and the mixture ratio of the invention are diisobutylamine : carbon disulfide : oxidant equals to 1 : 1-1.3 : 0.35-0.55; the production method is that enamel reaction axe with volume of 2000L is added with the diisobutylamine, alcohols or water and phase transfer catalyst with specified amount in turns; the cooling water is turned on with temperature reduced to the preferential temperature and is added with carbon disulfide liquid measured accurately by drops, and the time is controlled; after added by drops, the pH value of the reaction liquid is measured to the specialized range; after the pH value is stable, the preferential temperature is controlled and the oxidant is added by drops to carry out oxidation reaction. After the oxidation reaction, the insulation temperature is kept for 1h and solid-liquid separation is conducted to abandon the liquid and dry, crush, sieve and pack the solid.
