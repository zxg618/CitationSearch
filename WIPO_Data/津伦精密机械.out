The invention relates to a method for designing a linear sealing structure of box type parts provided with narrow (sealed) planes with complex shapes. When a standard O ring sealing structure is used for performing sealing on a narrow sealed plane with a complex shape, if the touched sealed plane has the complex shape and is too narrow, the sealing ring replacement or that the standard sealing groove width is bigger than that of the sealed plane is easily caused, so that the sealing cannot be formed. The invention develops a method for realizing sealing on the narrow sealed plane with the complex shape, which is different from the method for standard-sized O rings and grooves. Practices show that the linear sealing structure has good effect when the linear sealing structure is applied to the narrow sealed plane with the complex shape. The design method mainly comprises: firstly, the design of the width B of a sealing groove, which is to make B equal to 1.035 to 1.045 times of d, wherein d is the diameter of the cross section of an O-shaped sealing ring, and the depth t of the sealing groove is kept unchanged and still adopts the standard depth; and secondly, the design of the actual length L of the O-shaped sealing ring, which is to make L equal to 0.990 to 0.089 times of L0, wherein L0 is the theoretical length of the O-shaped sealing ring.
