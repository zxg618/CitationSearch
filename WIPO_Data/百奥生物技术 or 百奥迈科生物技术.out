The present invention relates to an engineering fungus strain of human insulin-like growth factor-1 and a process for preparing human insulin-like growth factor-1 with said fungus strain. Said engineering fungus strain is beer yeast cell, which contains the gene sequence of human insulin-like growth factor-1, which is able to encode 69 amino acids. It features that the 5' in said gene sequence is connected with an alpha-factor leading peptide sequence, before which a Kozak order is fused, which then is cloned to downstream of ethanol dehydrogenase promoter to form expression carrier. Finally, beer yeast cells are transformed to obtain the genetic engineering fungus strain BJ-IGF-1, which can secrete human insulin-like growth factor-1.
