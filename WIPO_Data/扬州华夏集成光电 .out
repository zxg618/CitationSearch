The invention relates to a crystal growth method with rotary continuous feeding and a device thereof, which belongs to the field of crystallization process technology. The method can achieve crystal growth by driving a crucible loaded with materials by a rotation mechanism to sequentially pass through an upper/lower loading region, a pre-melting region, a growing region and an annealing region. The device comprises a furnace body consisting of the upper/lower loading material, the pre-melting region, the growing region, the annealing and the rotation mechanism in annular arrangement. The device with annular arrangement can effectively reduce the crystal growth period by completing several key operations of the crystal growth process, can achieve continuous feeding and continuous growth to reduce the energy consumption and the cost, and can implement growth of a plurality of crystals. The method provided by the invention can be used for the growth of large-size flaky metal, semiconductor, ceramic and co-molten compound crystal (such as silicon, alumina, spinel, garnet, etc.), and can also be used for repeatedly purifying materials.
