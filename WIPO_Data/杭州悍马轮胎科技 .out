The invention provides a tyre filled with compound elastomer material and a preparation method thereof. The method comprises the steps: filling pretreated rubber into an inner cavity of the tyre; installing a wheel felloe; mixing prepolymer component A and assistant agent B of polyurethane, and injecting the component A and the component B into the inner cavity of the tyre by pressurizing equipment by an air nozzle; filling gaps among rubber granules; thoroughly filling to enable the pressure to achieve the specified requirement of the tyre; keeping the pressure of a sealing air nozzle and curing the polyurethane material to obtain a product. The tyre filled with the compound elastomer material has the advantages of better buffering performance, longer service life, anti-exploding performance, anti-puncture performance, inflation-free performance, maintenance-free performance, high carrying capability and the like of an ordinary solid tyre and is especially suitable for use under special conditions such as mines, quays and the like.

The invention is a polyurethane roller consists of outer rim and hub and its process method. Bearing is fixed on the inner surface of the hub. The inner surface of the outer rim is engaged with the outer surface of the hub by concave-convex structure. The outer rim is made of polyurethane material with Shore hardness of 90 up to 95A. The hub is made of polyurethane material with Shore hardness of 60 up to 65A. The outer rim is produced by injection molding with the polyurethane material of shore hardness of 90 to up to 95.The lateral section of the internal circuit side assumes the shape like the Chinese character 'tu'. The hub is gained by injecting with the polyurethane material with Shore hardness of 60 up to 65A into the mold with the heat treated bearing and the heated outer rim inside. The lateral section of the external circuit side assumes the shape like the Chinese character 'ao' corresponding with the lateral section of the internal circuit side. The inner circuit side of the hub is fit with the bearing. Take the roller to heat treatment at last. The invention is of simple processing method, low cost. The roller is light, rigid and very bearable.
