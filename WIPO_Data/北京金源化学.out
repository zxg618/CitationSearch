A process for producing 2-fluoro-6-halophenols as intermediates; a process for producing 2-alkoxy-3-fluorophenols, and further 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzenes, from the 2-fluoro-6-halophenols; a second process for producing 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzenes from the 2-fluoro-6-halophenols; and 2-alkoxy-3-fluorophenols. The above 2-fluoro-6-halophenols can be obtained through sulfonation reaction, halogenation reaction and deprotective reaction from 2-fluorophenol as a starting material. The 2-alkoxy-3-fluorophenols are obtained by alkyletherifying the 2-fluoro-6-halophenols and subsequently replacing the halogen atom thereof by hydroxyl. The 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzenes are obtained by further etherifying the 2-alkoxy-3-fluorophenols. Alternatively, the 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzenes are obtained by replacing the halogen atom of the 2-fluoro-6-halophenols by hydroxyl to thereby form 3-fluorocatechols and subsequently alkyletherifying two hydroxyls thereof. These processes realize low production cost and high yield, being suitable for industrial production of 1,2-dialkoxy-3-fluorobenzenes.

The present invention relates to coal additive and method for raising coke output and performance. The coal additive contains surface activating catalyst, co-solvent, permeation assistant and solvent. When the coal additive is used, the surface activating catalyst is dissolved in the solvent, added into coal through a specific mode, and distributed on the surface of coal and inside coal under the action of the permeation assistant. During producing coke, the coal additive is heated and the volatile component is separated out, to raise the output and performance of the produced coke. The high performance coke may be used in coal burning, dry distilling, gasifying, liquefying and other fields. The present invention can reach the aims of raising the utilization rate of coal, saving coal resource, reducing pollutant, etc.

The combustion catalyst for carbon-base fuel is prepared through compounding the main material and the auxiliary material into matrix, and dissolving the matrix in solvent. The main material includes alkyl alcohol ether, alkyl ester, olefin and aromatic compound; and the auxiliary material includes phosphate ester, chlorohydrocarbon, alkyl alcohol amide, metal compound and small amount of nitrogen, silicon and oxygen containing organic compound. When it is used, the combustion catalyst is mixed with carbon-base fuel through spraying or stirring. It promotes combustion by means of increasing the free radicals in the system, and can raise the combustion strength and efficiency and reach the aims of saving energy, raising efficiency, reducing pollution, etc.

This invention is using amino direct reaction and the diazotization to convert inter-isopropylaniline into other interposition substitutive cumene derivate. The inter-isopropylaniline is the by-products in the cumidine production process. It greatly expands the use of inter-isopropylaniline, which used to be waste material, and realizes the importance of environmental protection and conservation of resources.
