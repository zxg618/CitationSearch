The invention relates to a method for extracting human fibrinogen from a component I through column chromatography. The problem of low purity, high stability and high yield of the human fibrinogen can be effectively solved. The method comprises the following steps of: (1) dissolving and filtering FI precipitate; (2) inactivating S/D ; (3) precipitating glycine for the first time; (4) dissolving and filtering the precipitate obtained in the precipitation for the first time; (5) performing column chromatography; (6) precipitating glycine for the second time; (7) dissolving and filtering the precipitate obtained in the precipitation for the second time; (8) precipitating; (9) packing the product in bags and freeze-drying the product; and (10) inactivating the product through hot air. In the method, glycine serves as a precipitator, so the finally obtained product contains about 0.5 percent of glycine; and the glycine and arginine hydrochloride are combined to serve as a stabilizer of the product, so the stability of freeze-dried product can be improved and the quality, the purity and the yield of the final product are improved. Therefore, the method is an innovation for preparing the human fibrinogen.

The invention relates to a method for extracting human immune globulin from a component I+III or a component III, which can effectively extract human immune globulin from a component I+III or a component III so as to meet the demands of human immune globulin for people, and comprises the following steps: (1) dissolving the deposits of component I+III or component III; (2) removing the component I;(3) separating the component III; (4) separating a component II; (5) dissolving and filtering the component II; (6) ultrafiltering, dialyzing and concentrating; (7) purifying the component II; (8) purifying; and (9) ultrafiltering and dialyzing. The method is advanced, has simple process and can effectively separate the component II from the component I+III or the component III so as to further make the component II into a finished product of human immune globulin, and has very important realistic significance of relieving the short supply situation of domestic source plasma, not only sufficiently utilize raw materials but also prevent environmental pollution; therefore, the method has huge economic and social benefits.
