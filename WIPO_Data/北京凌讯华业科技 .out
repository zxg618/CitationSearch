In a system for generating TDS-OFDM, a method for generating LDPC codes is provided. The method comprises the steps of: constructing a base matrix; providing a plurality of sub-matrices for forming the base matrix, with each sub-matrix being a cyclic permutation matrix; and masking the base matrix using a small sparse matrix. The LDPC codes can be encoded in linear time using simple shift-registers with complexity linearly proportional to the length of the code for parallel encoding. The code and method of the present invention also optimizes the degree distributions of check nodes and bit nodes to make the error-floor lower than 10<-12>.

The present invention relates to a TDS-OFDM communication system receiver basing on the LDPC code, belongs to the communication technology field. The receivers demodulates the RF signal which is coded by the LDPC and is modulated by the TDS-OFDM and is downconverted to IF signal, and includes a synchronization block, an equalization block, an OFDM demodulation block and a FEC decoder block. The synchronization block generates a baseband signal from a digitized IF signal and performs correlation of a PN sequence in a signal frame of the received RF signal with a corresponding locally generated PN sequence to provide signals for performing carrier recovery, timing recovery and parameters for channel estimation. The equalization block performs channel estimation and channel equalization. The OFDM demodulation block performs demodulation on the baseband signal to recover OFDM symbols and converts the OFDM symbols to frequency domain. The FEC decoder block includes an LDPC decoder for decoding the OFDM symbols based on the LDPC code to generate a digital output signal indicative of the data content of the RF signal.

The present invention provides a reduced memory implementation for the min-sum algorithm compared to traditional hardware implementations. The improvement includes innovative MIN_SUM method with reduced memory requirements suitable of computer implementation that combines the traditional row update process and column update process into a single process, in that the traditional CNU unit and VNU unit are combined into a single CVNU unit. The improvement not only reduces the time required for decoding by half, but also reduces the logic and routing efforts. Furthermore, instead of storing the whole intermediate LLR values using a significant number of memories, only a set of parameters associated with the intermediate LLR values is stored. The set of parameters includes: 1. sign of LLR; 2. the minimum LLR, 3. sub-minimum LLR, and 4. the column location of minimum value in each row. Therefore, as compared with the traditional LDPC decoder implementation, the required memory size of the present invention is significantly or tremendously reduced.
