The invention discloses a method for producing high-purity manganese monoxide, which comprises the following steps: crushing an electrolytic manganese metal which is used as a raw material into a certain fineness, heating the electrolytic manganese metal powder to between 400 and 1,000 DEG C, introducing water vapor and inert gas or water vapor and carbon dioxide into the powder, thermally treating the mixture for 2 to 8 hours, and cooling the mixture to room temperature to obtain the high-purity manganese monoxide. The method has the advantages of sufficient, cheap and pure raw material, simple preparation process, low production cost, no environment pollution and high product purity.
