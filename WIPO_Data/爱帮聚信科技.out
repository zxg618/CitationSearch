The invention relates to a method and a device for determining locations and regions. The method comprises the following steps: matching a merchant with address data in an address database according to acquired address words and acquired key words; when detecting that the number of the references to the address data of the merchant is greater than a first threshold, determining a geometric figure according to a maximum coordinate value and a minimum coordinate value in the address data, partitioning the geometric figure and clustering blocks according to the distance between the blocks; if the number of the references to the address data of the merchant is no greater than the first threshold, outputting the address data of the merchant to an error record file; arranging clustering results in a descending order according to the quantity of the address data of each clustering result; calculating the centre and radius of each clustering result and deleting the clustering results at a distance greater than a second threshold to a first clustering result; and outputting the clustering results. The method for determining locations and regions of the invention can reduce information irrelevant to the search targets of a user in search results, improve search accuracy and save time and energy of the user.
