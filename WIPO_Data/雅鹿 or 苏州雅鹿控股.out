本发明公开了一种蜂蜜薄荷茶的制备方法，其制备方法包括：采集新鲜的薄荷进行筛选、杀青、水漂、控干后，采用糖度为83～87Be的浓缩蜂蜜分两次腌制，一次腌制将控干后的薄荷以薄荷:浓缩蜂蜜1:1之分量比腌制1～3d，而后将一次腌制后的薄荷与蜂蜜分离；接着在经一次腌制后的薄荷上层再次加入浓缩蜂蜜浸泡腌制15～20d进行二次腌制。让蜂蜜自然慢慢下沉，使薄荷均匀吸纳蜂蜜，将腌制缸中的少量空气挤压走，使蜂蜜能均匀分布于薄荷中；最后取出薄荷连同蜂蜜液，加热至温度63～73℃时调制蜂蜜糖度达到60～68Be装瓶。本发明制备过程中无须对其进行搅拌，减少薄荷翻动能减少薄荷断裂的机率，保留产品完整的外观，提高了蜂蜜薄荷茶质量、品位和市场竞争力。

A process for molten-iron production which comprises: charging a solid reduced iron obtained by reducing carbon composite iron oxide briquettes with heating, a carbon material, and a fluxing agent into a melting furnace of the iron bath type while bubbling an inert gas into a molten-iron layer in the melting furnace from a bottom tuyere disposed at the furnace bottom and thereby stirring the molten-iron layer; and injecting an oxygen-containing gas from a top lance disposed in the melting furnace and thereby burning the carbon material and/or the carbon contained in the molten iron to melt the solid reduced iron by the resultant combustion heat and produce molten iron. The carbon material is charged so that a slag layer made of a slag formed on the molten-iron layer when the solid reduced iron is melted into molten iron comes to have, in an upper layer part thereof, a slag layer containing the carbon material suspended therein and that a carbon-material covering layer consisting only of the carbon material is formed on the slag layer containing the carbon material suspended therein. The molten iron and slag stored in the melting furnace are discharged through a tap hole formed in a lower part of a side of the melting furnace.

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a treatment implement for treating a case of the serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to be widely used because of its low cost and easiness in carrying, capable of treating the patient while preventing the secondary infection to diffuse the pathogen on the periphery. SOLUTION: The treatment implement for the case of the SARS is formed in the shape of a plastic sleeping bag, and the patient is stored inside the implement by opening/closing upper and lower covers with fasteners on the back. An arch frame is inserted into an arch frame insertion part disposed on the upper part of the upper cover so that the upper cover is raised to form a dome. The upper cover has an air intake on the head side of the patient for connecting a pump for purifying air expired by the patient and an air intake with a filter on the foot side for taking in air. In addition, a treatment window is formed between the air intakes for a medical person to treat the patient. COPYRIGHT: (C)2005,JPO&NCIPI
