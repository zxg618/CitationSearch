The present invention relates to isolated polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity and isolated polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides. The invention also relates to nucleic acid constructs, vectors, and host cells comprising the polynucleotides as well as methods of producing and using the polypeptides.

713,913. Combs. DAVITCHO, S. I. Sept. 4, 1952, No. 22278/52. Class 131 A hair comb comprises one or more tooth-carrying elements mounted coaxially with respect to a rod or tube forming the back bone of the comb and rotatable between fixed limits about the longitudinal axis of the rod or tube. As shown, teeth 3 mounted on a carrier 4 project through a slot 6 in a tubular comb back 1 the slot being wide enough to allow limited rotation of the teeth. A cork or wooden plug 5 retains the. carrier in the tube. In a modification several independently movable carriers having teeth of different thicknesses and spacing are mounted co-axially in the tube and in a further modification tubular carriers of other than circular cross-section are mounted on a rod of similar cross-section and sufficiently smaller to allow angular movement of the teeth.

629,261. Tooth brushes; inclined bristles. DAVITCHO, S. I. July 3, 1946, No. 19938. [Class 19] A brush has transverse rows of bristle tufts, all the tufts of one transverse row being inclined to the left and of the adjacent row inclined to the right side relative to a vertical plane extending in the longitudinal direction of the brush back, the angle of inclination being such that the tufts of adjacent rows do not cross one another and that the ends of the tufts lie in the same operating face of the brush. In the figures, the bristle tufts 3 of a tooth brush are inclined to the right, and the tufts 2 of the adjacent transverse row to the left and the bristles lie with their ends in the operating face of the brush. The angle of inclination is preferably 10 to 30 degrees.
