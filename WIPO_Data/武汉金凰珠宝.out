The invention relates to a method for electroforming hard gold products. The method comprises the following steps: template picking, mould pouring, wax repairing and electric conducting layer coating are carried out to obtain a wax mould of a gold product to be processed, and a layer of electric conductive oil is coated on the surface of the wax mould; and a titanium net is taken as anode in the gold electroforming step, the wax mould coated with the electric conductive oil is put in an electrotyping bath as cathode, the electroforming solution is put in the electrotyping bath and includes sulfurous acid gold potassium, ammonium sulfite and potassium citrate, wherein the sulfurous acid gold potassium is combined with the ammonium sulfite, a trivalent gold ion is reduced into a univalent gold ion, the univalent gold ion generates close crystal grains, the close crystal grains are combined through the potassium citrate to form complexing gold through PH buffer solution, the gold is deposited on the wax mould to form a casting gold layer, and the half-finished product is prepared; and the wax film in the half-finished product and the electric conductive layer are removed in the wax removal step and the electric conductive layer removal step to obtain the finished product. The volume and the hardness of the gold product are changed by using the variation of the chemical structure of the gold ion, so that the hardness, the volume and the toughness of the gold product meet the standards simultaneously.

The invention relates to a solderless hollow bottom-sealed bracelet which comprises an external half part (1) and an internal half part (2) which are combined into a whole by argon-arc welding. The invention also provides a processing method of the solderless hollow bottom-sealed bracelet, which comprises the following steps of: (a) preparing the external half part (1) and the internal half part (2); (b) tightly matching the external half part (1) with the internal half part (2) by using a processing device; and (c) fusing the junction of the external half part (1) and the internal half part (2) by adopting argon-arc welding. The invention adopts a solderless rolling mode, and tightly closes the sealing of the external half part (1) and the bottom of the internal half part (2) by using the processing device, and the strength thereof is basically consistent with that of welding by welding agents, thus ensuring the purity of jewellery such as gold hollow bracelets, and the like, without welding agents.
