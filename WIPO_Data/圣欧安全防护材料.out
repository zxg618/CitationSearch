The invention relates to a method for preparing heterotypic meta-aromatic polyamide (MPIA) fiber with non-circular section. The meta-aromatic polyamide solution is squeezed directly into the low temperature coagulation bath containing surfactant after being neutralized and filtered, and the spinning shaped spun filament is carried out hot water stretching, washing and dry heat stretching to obtain finished MPIA fiber with non-circular section. The MPIA fiber with non-circular section obtained according to the method has larger specific surface area, more excellent textile processing performance, and is more suitable to fabricate high-temperature resistant synthetic fiber papers.

The invention relates to a method for spinning aramid fiber 1313 with low salt content by wet spinning. The method comprises the following steps of: prepolymerizing m-phenylenediamine (MPD) and part m-phthaloyl chloride (IPC); adding the preformed polymer and the rest m-phthaloyl chloride into a double-screw extruder to extrude the aramid fiber 1313 containing chlorine hydride; extruding spinning dope into a aqueous coagulation bath after neutralizing the chlorine hydride with calcium hydroxide; crimping and cutting coagulated tows into the required fiber length via hot water drawing, water rinsing, drying, dry-heat drawing and heat setting after being taken out of the coagulation bath to receive a finished fiber. The method is convenient and simple, can improve the molecular weight of products and the evenness of polycondensate, and reduce the salt content of the final spinning solution.

The invention relates to a method for preparing polyisophthaloyl metaphenylene diamide pulp-shaped fiber belonging to the special synthesis fiber preparation technique field, which is characterized in that the polyisophthaloyl metaphenylene diamide solution is mixed with a precipitant in a shaping equipment which rotates at certain speed, the polyisophthaloyl metaphenylene diamide solution dissolves out the pulp-shaped fiber in the shearing condition through the precipitant directly. The component of the precipitant contains organic solvent which is provided with high-apparent viscosity for adjusting the apparent viscosity of the precipitant, thereby the pulp-shaped fiber of different long diameter ratio is obtained to satisfy different application need of the product. The viscosity ratio of the precipitant and the pulp is enlarged and the force between the pulp and the precipitant is strengthened due to increasing the apparent viscosity of the precipitant, thereby the superior property pulp-shaped fiber can be obtained in the relatively low stirring rotary speed condition of the shaping equipment.
