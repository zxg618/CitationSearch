The invention relates to a tricolored functional fancy terylene composite yarn and the manufacturing method thereof, which solves the problems that the terylene fabric can be dyed three different colors and provided with the functions of moisture absorption, perspiration and ultraviolet resistance. The fancy composite yarn is formed through a fiber-blending compound of two types of non-textured yarns, i.e. a stretched MOY with a deformed semilustrous section and a deformed lustrous FDY and the synthesis ratio is 1 to 0.5-1.0. The procedures for manufacturing the fancy composite yarn is as follows: firstly, the two non-textured yarns are respectively fed to the two rollers of the equipment provided with a double-feeding system, a PLC (programmable logic controller) is used to conduct a programmed control to the feeding roller of the MOY with a deformed semilustrous section and a variable 3-speed stretching is conducted to the MOY with a deformed semilustrous section between the two rollers in different periods of time. The variable stretching ratio is 1.40 to 1.65; and secondly, the two types of non-textured yarns are blended and compounded on an elasticizing machine according to the compounding ratio.
