A pure resin type carbon ribbon for thermotransfer is composed of a carrier, a stripping layer and an ink layer on one surface of said carrier, and a refractory layer on another surface of said carrier. Its preparing process includes such steps as proportionally adding the C14-22 saturated fatty acid salt and ethane-vinyl acetate copolymer resin to solvent, stirring to obtain the stripping layer liquid, coating it onto one surface of carrier, by intaglio printing, drying, coating ink layer by intaglio printing, coating a refractory layer on another surface of carrier, and drying.

The method comprises: using the supporter and the thin line grid mesh formed on the supporter to compose a conducting film. The thin line grid mesh is composed of silver and copper coated on the silver; the quantity of the copper is 55%-90 % of total mass. The line width of grid mesh is 5-25 mu m; the opening ratio is 85%-95%; the surface resistance is more than 0ohm and less than 5ohm. The preparation method comprises: coating silver salt layer and its protective layer, and applies grid mesh exposure and developing process; the exposed part respectively forms metal silver part; the un-exposure part forms the transparent part; the metal silver part is thickened and made with activation treatment; coating the metal to form conducting metal part.
