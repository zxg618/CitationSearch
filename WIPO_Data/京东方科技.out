A touch screen, display device and driving method thereof. A transparent conductive layer (400) is added in a structure of the touch screen and is disposed on a side of an array substrate (100) facing away from an opposite substrate (200). The transparent conductive layer (400) is used as a shielding layer to load touch detection signals that are the same with those of touch detection electrodes (300) in a touch time period. A capacitor structure is formed between the shielding layer (400) and a metal layer (600) below the screen. A change of distance between the shielding layer (400) and the metal layer (600) below the screen caused by screen deformation occurred when the touch screen is pressed by a finger, only affects the capacitance of the capacitor structure between the shielding layer (400) and the metal layer (600) to cause the change of the touch detection signals loaded by the shielding layer (400), and would not interfere the capacitance change of the touch detection electrodes (300). Therefore, the present invention can effectively improve the accuracy of touch sensing.
