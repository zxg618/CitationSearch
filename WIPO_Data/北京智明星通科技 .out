The invention provides a method and system for displaying tens of thousands of people on the same screen of a game. Image information in a game image file to be built is acquired, the game image file is built according to the image information acquired by an image information acquiring module, shielding relations and shielding ranges are judged according to position coding information in the image information and collision detection regions, and finally the image file is alternatively rendered according to the judged information and displayed. The method and system have the advantages that when the number of pixels like people or buildings is too large, only a little drawing is needed by a GPU to accomplish a game picture, the number of times of screen refreshing is greatly reduced, the refreshing rate is increased, the display speed is high, the phenomenon that images are not fluent is avoided, the game picture can be smoothly displayed for game users, shielding relations between dynamic pixels and static pixels in the game exist, and the game is more appropriate, practical and interesting and can be played for a longer period of time.
