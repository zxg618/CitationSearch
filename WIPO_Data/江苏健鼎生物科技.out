The invention discloses a preparation method of D-Glucosamine Hydrochloride, wherein citric acid waste residue, gained after production of the citric acid with a fermentation method, are used as raw material, and the D-Glucosamine Hydrochloride is prepared by the steps of hydrolysis, pumping filtration, concentration, etc. According to the invention, the citric acid waste residue is recycled, so that the waste residue pollution of the environment is mitigated; and the D-Glucosamine Hydrochloride produced with the citric acid waste residue as raw material is a D-Glucosamine Hydrochloride of vegetarian diet which has no fishlike smell, is not polluted by heavy metal, is safe and environmentally friendly, has a product purity up to 98-102% and accords with the quality standard of United States Pharmacopeia USP 32 edition. At the same time, because raw material resource is abundant, production resource has no restriction and production cost is low; further, cost in treatment of the environmental pollution is saved and relatively high circular economic gain is achieved; and more preferably, under the circumstance that technology prejudice in the technology field is overcome and simultaneously the product purity is guaranteed, output and production efficiency of the product are increased and time of the hydrolysis reaction is shortened.
