The invention discloses a processing technology of composite dried beef having beef liver and tendon; and beef, beef liver, beef tendon, and casein are employed as original accessories. The processing technology comprises the following steps: boiling beef and cutting the boiled beef into small pieces; boiling beef liver and chopping the boiled beef liver into minced one, and then mixing the small pieces of beef and minced beef liver to obtain a material having beef and liver; adding food-grade casein, white sugar, black powdered pepper and water into the material having beef and liver, and performing mixing to obtain a mixed material having beef and liver; stewing, moulding and slicing beef tendon; putting a piece of translucent tendon slice between two layers of the mixed material having beef and liver to form a three-layer overlapping complex; and carrying out hot-air drying, microwave drying, and sterilizing, and then performing packing by a vacuum film or packing in a monoblock candy manner to obtain a finished product. According to the invention, dried beef produced by the processing technology is rich in nutrition, and has a layered shape, distinctive flavor, as well as loose and flexible taste; besides, the product the dried beef is novel. Moreover, the composite dried beef having beef liver and tendon is easy to produce and demands of various consumers can be met. Cattle byproducts resources are utilized fully, which enables the benefit of the beef cattle industry to be promoted.

The invention discloses a bilirubin extracting production method with animal blood in vitro enzymatic degradation, which comprises three major steps of: hemachrome extraction, hemachrome biotransformation and bilirubin extraction and refinement. The invention has a major improvement that in the hemachrome biotransformation, a reaction system of the heme oxygenase and the biliverdin reductase is built by collecting fresh animal livers and spleen cell sap without extraction and purification of a heme oxygenase and a biliverdin reductase, thus greatly lowering the technical difficulty of the existing enzymatic degradation methods and leading the bilirubin production to be developed towards industrial production. Furthermore, in acidic acetone extraction of hemachrome, the production method directly adjusts pH value of extracting liquid, leads hemachrome to be naturally precipitated, and repeatedly uses acetone that is obtained from leaching, thus avoiding solvent loss caused by distillation recycling of acetone, and lowering energy consumption and pollution. The bilirubin extracting production method with animal blood in vitro enzymatic degradation further has the advantages of reasonable design of technical steps, simple and convenient implementation, high hemachrome transformation ratio and good product quality, and the like.

The invention provides a method for extracting bilirubin from oxgall. The method comprises three steps of reducing biliverdin in the oxgall, forming calcium bilirubinate, extracting and refining the bilirubin. The method has an improvement point of adding the biliverdin reducing step capable of reducing the biliverdin contained in the oxgall and the biliverdin oxidized during collection or storage into the bilirubin so as to increase the bilirubin content of the oxgall, which is an important step for improving yield. Meanwhile, neutral calcium chloride or calcium sulfate is added in the step of forming the calcium bilirubinate as a calcium bilirubinate forming agent, the pH value of feed liquid can not be changed when calcium ions are formed after decomposition, so as to ensure complete formation of the calcium bilirubinate in the feed liquid and improve yield. Through the improvements, the yield of the method can reach 0.008 to 0.011 percent, which is improved by 0.003 percent than the prior art.
