The invention discloses a rectification circuit for radio frequency electronic tags. The rectification circuit at least comprises N rectifying units, and each of the rectifying units is in a difference structure, thus full-wave rectification for signals is implemented and the utilization rate of the signals is increased, in addition, a bias voltage is offered to grids of rectifying tubes by arranging a bias voltage generating tube so that all the rectifying tubes are in a subthreshold state, and meanwhile, a grid stabilization capacitor is used for reducing the impact from grid-source parasitic capacitances of the rectifying tubes, thereby stabilizing a grid voltage and reducing the impact on the bias voltages of the grids, caused by the fluctuation of a source signal.

The invention discloses an ultrahigh frequency radio frequency identification reader-writer. The reader-writer at least comprises an antenna, coupling equipment, a receiving module, an emitting module, a digital processing circuit, a local oscillation generating circuit and other circuit modules, wherein the local oscillation generating circuit comprises two phase-locked loop circuits and a frequency mixer; one phase-locked loop circuit outputs a first coarse tuning working frequency band with a relatively large frequency hopping step length; the other phase-locked loop circuit outputs a second fine tuning working frequency band with a relatively small frequency hopping step length; and local oscillation needed by the reader-writer is obtained by frequency conversion on the frequency mixer. Therefore, phase noise of the reader-writer is optimized greatly and the reading and writing sensitivity and reading and writing distance of the reader-writer are enhanced obviously; moreover, information security is enhanced to a certain extent through large-range frequency hopping.

The invention relates to an AVS run decoding method belonging to the technical field of digital voice and video decoding. The AVS run decoding method is characterized in that: for a run array, a level value is firstly decoded, and then a corresponding run value is decoded. The invention substantially needs no a register for storing and getting a run-level array, thereby omitting the register for storing and getting the run-level array. A chip designed by using the invention has small area, and meanwhile, the chip has the advantages of fast speed, no lag delay and low power consumption during a run decoding process.

The invention provides an address mapping method of an off-chip dynamic memory of a video hardware decoder, pertaining to the technical field of audio and video decoding technologies. The mapping method includes the following steps: (1) a line pixel of a line macroblock of an image is mapped into one line of one of the memory arrays in the dynamic memory; a continuous next line pixel of the same line macroblock is mapped into the same line of the next memory array; (2) according to the method adopted by the step (1), N memory arrays are alternately mapped till all the pixels of the line macroblock are mapped and then the continuous next line macroblock of the image is mapped. The mapping method of the invention can improve the access efficiency of the dynamic memory.
