The invention relates to a method for synchronizing a clock of an on-chip emulator clock of a C core C310 embedded microprocessor chip to a microprocessor clock domain. In testing, a test clock signal j_tclk is latched sequentially by a first register and a second register of the microprocessor clock domain; after a signal of the output end of the second register is reversed, the signal and a signal of the output end of the first register are subjected to logic and calculation to obtain a first pulse to allow a signal j_tclk_rise to be used for controlling the sampling of a test mode selection signal j_tms and a test data input signal j_tdi by a register of the emulator; and simultaneously, after the test clock signal j_tclk is reversed, the test clock signal j_tclk and the signal of the output end of the second register are subjected to logic and calculation to obtain a second pulse to allow a signal j_tclk_fall to be used for controlling the sampling of a test data output signal j_tdo by the register of the emulator, therefore, a microprocessor chip structure with the on-chip emulator is realized under a single clock domain.

The invention relates to a safety control method of a user multi-partitioned memory space access right in an embedded system, which comprises that: an initiating address comparator determines a block to which a program initiating position belongs, and a target address comparator determines a block to which a program target position belongs; a time delay matching register set is used for delaying program address value to ensure that data address value input by the target address comparator is the same access as the program address value input by the initiating address comparator; and whether the block capable of accessing eigenvalue is accessed by other blocks is judged and read by comparing identification signals of the program initiating position and the program target position so as to prevent information in the block from being called by the other block programs. The method obviously improves the safety of the operation of the embedded system.
