本发明公开了一种具有节电功能的定位跟踪装置及其节电方法。该定位跟踪装置采用频率不同的双控制模块进行工作，控制模块不需要连续不断地接入和检测数据。只有传感器模块或者电池出现异常时，从控模块才会进入正常模式，当位置数据发送至主控模块后，又会进入睡眠模式。而主控模块被从控模块唤醒，将位置数据发送后，又会进入睡眠模式。本发明最大程度地增加控制模块在睡眠模式下的工作时间，使得整个定位跟踪装置的总能耗最小化，同时也延长了电池的寿命。

A porous-structured diamond micrograin film known as a film of high heat resistance and low dielectric constant also exhibits high thermal conductivity and is promising as a multilayer wiring insulating film of semiconductor integrated circuit devices. However, diamond micrograin liquid compositions as a film raw material have had poor colloid stability and in film production, have exhibited poor reproducibility and yield. Diamond micrograin colloid liquid composition can have strikingly low viscosity and high stability when a small amount of amine is incorporated therein. Various coaters can be utilized by adjusting the viscosity thereof to desirable level with the use of a thickening agent according to necessity. As a result, a film of low dielectric constant exhibiting a specific inductive capacity of about 2.5 has been obtained. Further, the above liquid composition can be used as a finishing abradant.
