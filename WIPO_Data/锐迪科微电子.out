The invention discloses an output stage circuit of an operational amplifier, which comprises two triodes M1 and M2 with the drain electrodes thereof connected together, wherein the drain electrodes of the triodes M1 and M2 are used as an output terminal, the source electrode of the triode M2 is connected with a power end, the source electrode of the triode M1 is grounded, the grid electrode of the triode M1 is used an input terminal, the grid electrode of the triode M2 is connected with a resistor R1, the resistor R1 is not connected with one end of the triode M2 and used as a voltage biasing input terminal, and a capacitor C1 is connected between the triodes M1 and M2. The invention adds a capacitor between the grid electrodes of the two triodes, so as to omit a constant voltage source circuit, remarkably simply the circuit, as well as to improve the conduction of the circuit, increase the maximum output circuit, and improve the output efficiency of the output stage.
