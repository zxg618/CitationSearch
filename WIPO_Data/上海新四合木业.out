The invention relates to a four-layer solid wood composite floor and the manufacture method. The surface plate of four-layer solid wood composite floor is the horizontal and vertical stitching structure and the composite floor comprises a surface solid wood plate, a core plate and a back plate. It is characterized in that a gluing single plate is set between the surface solid wood plate and the core plate and said four-layer plates are bonded with each other; the surface solid wood plate is constituted by short solid blocks gluing in wood fiber direction along horizontal and vertical orders; the thickness of said gluing single plate is less than the one of said core plate. Compared with prior technologies, 1 the invention solves the problem that when the horizontal and vertical stitching thin plate is used as the surface plate to glue with the soft wood core plate, it is bad intensity and easy crack. 2 the invention avoids the floor deformation of wood generated by circumstance temperature and moisture changes so that the floor stability is improved by 6 to 8 times; because it is the gluing single plate under the surface plate, the bonding intensity of end stitching surface plate is strengthened effectively. At the same time the invention makes full use of short hard woods, which can not be used in producing the integral surface plate, and saves the resource of rare tree species.

The present invention relates to one kind of five-layer thick-core wooden floor board and its making process. The five-layer thick-core wooden floor board includes one surface wood layer, one gummed sheet layer, one core layer, one other gummed sheet layer and one back layer adhered together successively. The making process of the five-layer thick-core wooden floor board includes the following steps: making surface wood board, making core layer board, making gummed sheet, making back board, combination and pressing, splitting and balancing, and forming. The five-layer thick-core wooden floor board of the present invention has the advantages of less deformation caused by environment temperature and humidity, reduced surface wood layer thickness resulting in saving in high quality wood, and raised adhesion strength and high stability.
