The invention provides a method for implementing on-line user search through an instant messenger. An MSN base communication module, a multi-robot account management module, a robot session communication module, a service logic module and a background database service module are applied. The whole system users can be divided into MSN users and web users (Xmpp), session of users and robots is constructed on line by adopting a distributed cluster mode, and the service logic module sends the session result to the background database service module. The method can effectively realize intercommunication of Web and im tools, realize user communication of a multi-channel mode, realize interaction on msn and web, realize the on-line user search, meanwhile support instant search of msn and web, and reach chatting interaction between the msn and the web and search of on-line users.
