The invention discloses a game sound-lip synchronization system, which consists of an input content analysis module, a Chinese character-to-pinyin module, a pinyin-to-animation sequence information module, an animation sequence information analysis module and a final animation application module connected in turn. A method for the system comprises the following steps of: analyzing the input content; generating single Chinese characters in a unified format and pronunciation time length of the Chinese characters; generating Chinese character pinyin in a unified format and pronunciation time length of the Chinese characters; generating animation sequence information in a unified format and pronunciation time length of the Chinese characters; generating single animation sequence information in a unified format and animation playing time, the single animation sequence information and animation playing time, fusion time of the next animation sequence information; and applying. The game sound-lip synchronization system can automatically realize sound-lip synchronization in real time through the Chinese characters according to the speech contents of game animation, has high real-time property, is easy to use and convenient to adjust, and is a unique game system capable of automatically generating sound-lip synchronization through the Chinese characters at present.

The invention relates to a method for automatically realizing sound and lip synchronization through Chinese characters. The method at least comprises the following steps of: inputting a text by a user; analyzing the input text, and unifying the input text into standard data sequence information; converting data according to the Chinese-pinyin corresponding table to generate standard data sequence information, and converting data according to the information in an animation sequence and the pronunciation time of the entire Chinese characters to generate a standard finial data structure; and applying the finial data structure to a specific rendering engine. The Chinese characters can be used for automatically realizing sound and lip synchronization in real time through the content of conversation; the software in the invention has the advantages of strong practicability, simple use and convenient adjustment, and is the only one software capable of automatically producing sound and lip synchronization through Chinese characters in the present market.
