The invention relates to a process for purifying Fc fusion protein. The Fc fusion protein involved in the invention comprises but is not limited to recombinant human Fc fusion pegylated interferon (Fc-IFN). The process for purifying the Fc fusion protein combines the factors of the characteristics of Fc fusion protein, the requirements of purity and yield of purified samples, and the requirements of the amplification of the subsequent purification process and the preparation and formula and the like. A purification process which is suitable for industrial production is determined through laboratory research and scaled-up pilot test research. The process comprises the steps of centrifuging and pre-treatment, primary purification of ProteinA SepharoseFF chromatography and refined purification of Q-Sepharose FF and G25 Sephadex chromatography. The purity of the target protein obtained by purification reaches over 95 percent, the protein purification yield reaches over 40 percent, and the purity and yield of the target protein are improved. Research results prove that: the purification process is simple and convenient and suitable for industrial scale-up production, and the purity and the yield of the target protein are high.

The production process of the present invention has high expression amount and simple separation and purification steps. The present invention provides also corresponding expression vector and engineering bacterial.
