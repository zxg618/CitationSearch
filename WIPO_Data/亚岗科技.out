An optical thin film, the substrate of which is directly taken as a light-scattering layer, comprises a light-scattering substrate which can scatter the entering light and a prism array layer formed on the light-scattering substrate so as to form the optical thin film, thereby improving the light uniformity of optical lenses or optical objects (used for, such as LCDs and so on) under the light-scattering action of the light-scattering substrate and gaining the luminance of the optical lenses or the optical objects under the light-collecting action of the prism array layer.

The invention comprises a transparent base layer and a prism layer containing multi prisms and located on said transparent base layer. It features the following: multi micro lenses are located on the surface of the prism; by passing through the micro lenses, the light projected on the prism will be outputted in a direction more trending to the optical axis so as to increase the brightness of the optical film.

The present invention discloses an optical thin film of multi peak and partial peak multistage type optical collecting, as well as a method to manufacture the multistage type optical thin film. The present invention comprises a transparent basic level, and a plurality of multistage type prism levels arranged connectively on the basic unit. The multistage type prism levels form a plurality of peaks, and each peak assumes a tapering and narrowing structure towards the light direction (for example upwardly), thus being able to enhance the light concentrating effect, and increasing the brightness of the optical thin film and the luminous flux.

The invention relates to a multi-layer optical film and the fabricating method. The multi-layer optical film comprises a basic layer, a middle layer with concave-convex pattern connected on the basic layer and a prism array layer formed on the middle layer with pattern. Whereinto, the difference of refractive index of middle layer with concave-convex patter and prism array layer generates concentration light entering into the prism and light outputting direction is changed by full reflection and refraction in the prism. Furthermore light dispersion is limited to increase brightness and decrease light loss. Concave-convex structure solidified on the middle layer can increase rigidity of optical film to avoid the phenomenon of uneven light and shadow generated by screen. Because of interlocking between the prism array layer and concave-convex pattern in the middle layer interface bonding strength is strengthened.

The invention discloses a multi-layer compound optical film with light collecting and diffusion effects and the fabricating method. The multi-layer optical film comprises a prism array upper layer for collecting light formed on a diffusion layer. The bottom of prism array upper layer extends downwards to form several root parts so as to form interlocking with the diffusion layer to strengthen bonding between layers. The diffusion layer is formed to strengthen light diffuse transmission as nanometer or micrometer grains are dispersed in optical hardening or thermal hardening resin or as other compound resin, which can diffuse light, is coated or a coarse face for light diffusion is form directly. In this way the compound optical film with light collecting and diffusion effects is constituted to strengthen luminance, uniformity and strength of optical film. A basic layer can also be connected under the diffusion layer.

This invention relates to a multi-section light harvesting optical film. The invention includes a substrate film and many glass prisms. Stated substrate film is high penetration rate material. Stated glass prism links on substrate film. Glass prism links each other to be array. And every glass prism at least includes an upper glass prism element and at least an inferior glass prism element. This inferior glass prism element links substrate film. And zenith of inferior glass prism element forms a first zenith angle. The upper glass prism element links superior extremity of inferior glass prism element. And zenith of upper glass prism element forms a secondary zenith angle. The invention makes light loss of light total reflection or refraction between upper and inferior glass prisms decrease by first zenith angle of inferior glass prism element and secondary zenith angle of upper glass prism element. The invention can link to be integration by concatenation of upper and inferior glass prism elements with no concatenation of interface element. The invention can effectively upgrade brightness and light flow of poor light module. This invention also includes method for producing above optical film.
