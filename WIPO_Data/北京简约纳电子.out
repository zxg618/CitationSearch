A system and method for short-distance wireless communication are provided. The system comprises: an antenna array, including a central antenna and at least two circumambient antennas which are centrosymmetrical with respect to the central antenna, and adapted to receive signals from a tag in the near field of the antenna array; a baseband processing unit (50), calculating and determining the distance of the tag in the near-field of the antenna array based on the phase difference of received signals, and determining whether to communicate with the tag according to the distance. The system and method are able to more precisely determine the near-field distance between the tag and the reader based on the phases of signals.

The invention provides an SIM card with the radio frequency identification function and a power-saving method thereof. The SIM card comprises an RFID module and a power management module, wherein the RFID module comprises a radio frequency module and a timing module; wherein, the power management module closes the power output to parts in the RFID module, except for the timing module, after completion of scheduled application; when the timing module is in use, ,the power management module opens power output to the RF module when the set time comes, so that the RF module detects RF signals; and once the RF module detects at least one RF signal of set frequency, the power management module opens power output to the RFID module. The SIM card with radio frequency identification device can reach the purpose of power saving.

The invention discloses a single processor core based instruction processing method and a processor. The method comprises the following steps of: confirming that a plurality of instruction sequences belonging to one application are irrelevant; inserting a branch instruction before a plurality of instruction sequences and a joint instruction behind; and then, concurrently executing a plurality of instruction sequences marked by the branch instruction and the joint instruction by the processor core. Through the branch and the joint instructions, software can establish a virtual multi-thread mechanism among a plurality of function blocks of one application so as to improve the operation speed of the application.
