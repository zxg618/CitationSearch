The invention discloses a polyamide film which comprises a first surface layer, a core layer and a second surface layer, wherein the first surface layer and the second surface layer contain fatty polyamide. The polyamide film is characterized in that the core layer contains 10-20 percent by weight of amorphous semi-aromatic polyamide and 80-90 percent by weight of fatty polyamide. The polyamide film can be cooked at high temperature of 121 DEG C or even 135 DEG C and no S-shaped warping or delamination is generated after the cooking. The polyamide film can be widely applied to food package, in particular to the field of high-temperature resistant cooked food package. The invention further discloses a method for preparing a polyamide film which is resistant to high-temperature cooking.

The present invention is preparation process of 2-acryl amido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid, and relates to compound synthesis process. The preparation process has low cost and high product purity, and is suitable for industrial production. The preparation process includes the following steps: reaction of acrylonitrile, fuming sulfuric acid and introduced gasified isobutene in a reactor at the temperature from -4 deg.c to 0 deg.c, cooling, separating and drying to obtain coarse 2-acryl amido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid product; dissolving the coarse product in 0.5-50 wt% concentration acetic acid solution at 70-100 deg.c, cooling to 65-60 deg.c, vacuum distilling to separate 1/3-1/2 of the acetic acid solution, cooling to 20 deg.c, maintaining for 1 hr and centrifugally drying to operate high purity 2-acryl amido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid.
