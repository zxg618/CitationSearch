A Chinese character input method used in the digital electrical appliance; the Chinese character components written into the storage database are displayed on the display screen by means of the index prompt line; the selector key on the keyboard can be used to select the contents in the displayed index prompt line, so as to enter the component selection; As per the selector keys on the keyboard, selecting the contents in the component prompt line, so that the required components can be inputted. Two components are inputted at most, and then the whole Chinese character is inputted. If the Chinese character with the repetition code appears, the whole Chinese character can be inputted as pressing the relevant selector keys in the repetition code prompt line. The utility model only uses a couple of primary indexes which can induct more indexes via the quadratic index, so that the artificial component-key mapping table, so as to thoroughly solve the setbacks as learning the character pattern input method. Each Chinese character is composed of the primary component and the sub-component at most. Also, duplication of code, high frequency character and associated phases are introduced, so as to thoroughly solve the problems which can not be resolved in the existing input methods. Therefore, the utility model has the advantages of easy to learn, less repetition codes and high efficiency.
