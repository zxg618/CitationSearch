Disclosed is a dedusting process and dedusting tower for an oil-air mixture. The process comprises the following steps: dedusting by filtering the oil-air mixture, then dedusting by spraying an oil of the same type, and converting the oil droplets adhering to the dust from a liquid state to a gaseous state during the falling of the dust. The tower comprises a tower body (1) with an oil-air mixture inlet (2) at the lower end thereof, in which tower body (1) a filtrating and dedusting mechanism and a spraying device (6) thereabove with the oil of the same type are provided; the filtrating and dedusting mechanism comprises a dedusting rotary cage (5) controlled by a transverse rotation shaft, and the total volume of the packing particles filled into the dedusting rotary cage (5) in a natural state is smaller than the volume of the dedusting rotary cage (5). The dedusting process and dedusting tower can improve the quality of the oil and carbon black obtained and alleviate environmental pollution.

本实用新型涉及一种油气输送设备，具体涉及一种带有除尘设备的油气输送装置，该装置上部设置有油气出口，装置下部腔体一端为油气入口，另一端连接有粉尘输出管道，该管道上设置有出料口，管道内设置有出料螺旋，出料螺旋一端伸入腔体内，一端安装在输出管道外端，出料口两侧的螺旋旋片旋向相反，且两侧旋片间有间距；采用这种结构后，油气进入腔体后从油气出口排出，在这一过程中，由于重力的作用，油气中所携带的粉尘及固体杂质会沉降到腔体底面，进而可以通过螺旋旋转将其送出腔体外，通过出料口排出，由于采用了正反螺旋的设置，使得物料在出料口处实现了密堆积，从而实现了密封出料。

The invention relates to a technology and equipment for dedusting mixed oil gas, in particular to the technology and the equipment for dedusting mixed oil gas formed by splitting waste rubber and waste plastic. The technology is characterized in that the oil gas is sprayed and dedusted by same type of oil after being filtered and dudusted; and when dust falls, and oil adhered on the dust is converted into gaseous state from liquid state. The equipment comprises a tower body of which the lower end is provided with an oil gas inlet, wherein the tower body is internally provided with a filtering and dedusting mechanism and a spraying device for same type of oil, and the spraying device is arranged above the filtering and dedusting mechanism; the filtering and dedusting mechanism comprises dedusting rotary cage controlled by a lateral shaft; and the total volume of the filler filled into the dedusting rotary cage under the natural state is smaller than the volume of the dedusting rotary cage. In the invention, the reasonable technology and the reasonable equipment are adopted for dedusting and purifying oil obtained by splitting waste rubber and waste plastic, oil discharging quality and carbon black quality are improved, environmental pollution is lightened, thus providing a new path for solving the increasingly serious energy crisis, so that the technology and the equipment can be widely popularized and used.
