The present invention relates to a method and system for structuring and providing employee compensation in the form of securities that are linked to the employer's equity but issued by a third party entity. The third-party issued securities allow the employer to avoid ongoing economic risks often associated with traditional employee compensation, provide employees with the same retention benefits as provided by traditional employee compensation, and provide the third-party entity with financial opportunities through the hedging of such third-party issued securities.

The present invention relates to a method and system for offering a novel mandatorily convertible securities (e.g., DECS) by using a third party entity (either a corporate entity or a newly-formed independent trust) to: 1) issue and sell novel DECS to market investors; 2) obtain from a first entity shares of common stock in a second entity, or rights to receive such shares in the future, to satisfy the mandatory conversion requirement of the DECS; 3) sell or retain the rights to any residual value obtained after satisfying the obligation to DECS investors; and 4) use the proceeds from such sale or retained value to fund a portion of the DECS coupon. As compared to a traditional DECS, the use of the third party intermediary allows the first entity to: recognize an accounting gain/loss on its underlying position in the second entity up front on the day of sale of the novel DECS; avoid the creation of debt on the balance sheet of the first entity; avoid any mark-to-market through the income statement each fiscal quarter, which would produce income statement volatility.
