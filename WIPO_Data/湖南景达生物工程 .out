The invention discloses a method for jointly detecting hepatitis C virus (HCV) antigen-antibody. A monoclonal antibody of an anti-HCV core antigen and a chimeric antigen are coated with enzyme-linked plate to be detected simultaneously, so that the method can shorten the 'window period' of HCV virus detection. Moreover, HCV antibodies in serum and the compatibility with the coated monoclonal antibody can be detected as possible so as to avoid the combination of the chimeric antigen and the monoclonal antibody by modifying HCV overall length core antigen, telescoping non-structural areas and realizing the expression of the chimeric antigen, and the positive detection rate is close to the PCR positive detection rate. The HCV detection method also has the advantages of simple operation, low price, so the method is suitable for promotion and application.

This invention discloses one method to test hepatitis C virus total nuclear antigen, which hcomprises the following steps: testing front protein transformation agent and non-ion surface activity agent to pre-process this sample; then adopting hepatitis C to test the nuclear antigen enzyme immune dialogue case. This invention pre-process can impact Ig molecule transformation area especially long area to reduce its combination opportunity with antigen to promote antigen compound isolation and to make the nuclear antigen fully exposed.
