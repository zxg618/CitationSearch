The invention relates to a discharge plasma diffusion welding manufacture method for Laval nozzles and belongs to the welding field. The method comprises the steps of (1) blanking, (2) machine shaping, wherein the welding position roughness <= 1.6 micrometers; (3) chemical degreasing and surface oxide removing; (4) drying, which is performed in a drying box of an air blower; (5) assembly; (6) discharge plasma diffusion welding; (7) finish turning. The method has the advantages that the process problem of discharge plasma diffusion welding of or Laval nozzle components is solved, and a positive role is played in the promotion and application of the diffusion welding of the Laval nozzle components in spacecrafts; the welded rate is high, and the joint strength is identical to the strength of base materials; the member deformation is small, the size accuracy is high, and product design requirements can be met; the method is free of environmental pollution and capable of being automated easily.
