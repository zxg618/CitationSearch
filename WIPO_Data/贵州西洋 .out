The invention relates to a method for producing light calcium carbonate and coproducing hydrogen sulfide by using crude calcium sulfide, belonging to the technical field of chemical production. The method comprises the steps of: pulverizing the crude calcium sulfide, and dissolving out the pulverized crude calcium sulfide by using saturated hydrogen sulfide solution at room temperature to obtain sulfur calcium hydroxide solution; removing other impurities in the crude calcium sulfide by filtering and washing, and introducing CO2 into clear solution to generate precipitation of light calcium carbonate and continuously generate hydrogen sulfide gas; preparing the saturated hydrogen sulfide solution by using part of the generated hydrogen sulfide gas, and delivering the rest of the hydrogen sulfide gas to a gas holder for storage; filtering and washing feed liquid generated from carbonatation reaction to obtain light calcium carbonate solid; introducing the hydrogen sulfide gas into the filtrate to prepare the saturated hydrogen sulfide solution, and returning to the previous step to dissolving out the crude calcium sulfide for recycling; and drying, crashing and packaging the light calcium carbonate to obtain a finished product of light calcium carbonate. The light calcium carbonate product has less impurity and high whiteness compared with that produced by the traditional method, and the byproduct hydrogen sulfide can be used as raw material of other chemical products.
