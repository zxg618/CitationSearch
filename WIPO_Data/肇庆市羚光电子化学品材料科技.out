The invention discloses a method for preparing silver micro-powder for high-temperature sintering silver pastes, which comprises the following steps: preparing a colloidal liquid silver system, a colloidal reduction system and protection solution firstly; then mixing the three. In the invention, a sol gel process and a solution chemical reduction method are used to effectively control the reaction process, so that the industrialized production can be performed stably, and the uniform reaction under the condition of production enlarging still can be ensured, thereby greatly improving the uniformities of shapes and other superficial characteristics of silver particles generated by reaction, and eventually generating flocculating soft silver powder wodges which are easy to carry out post-processing such as collecting and washing, and the like.

This invention discloses an additive for pure-tin plating solution of tin methanesulfonic sulfate series and the solution added this additive, which comprises the following components: (1) non-ionic surfactants; (2) aminated compound; (3) ampholytic surfactant. There isn't toxin such as lead and fluorin, and it is current density of wider rang, high current efficiency and shorter electroplating time. And it is homogeneous surface of coating after electroplating, good film thickness uniformity and surface wettable effect, good durability of weld,strong and tight cohesion of the coating and
