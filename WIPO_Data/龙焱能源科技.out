The invention provides a manufacturing method of a BIPV film photovoltaic assembly. The manufacturing method includes the steps of providing a conventional film photovoltaic assembly which comprises a plurality of strip-shaped film photovoltaic cells and processing the conventional film photovoltaic assembly by means of a laser reticle process to form light-transmitting belts which are more than 0.3mm wide. Due to the fact that the width of the light-transmitting belt is increased, compared with an existing BIPV film photovoltaic assembly which has the same size and same transmittance, the BIPV film photovoltaic assembly has less light-transmitting belts; when the light-transmitting belts are manufactured, influences on film semiconductor layers on the boundaries of the light-transmitting belts are correspondingly reduced, and accordingly the output power of the BIPV film photovoltaic assembly is improved. Besides, due to increase of the width of a non-light-transmitting portion, namely a sub assembly, influences of defects on the output power are greatly reduced.

The invention discloses a temperature control device for a solar cell accelerated aging test. During operation, simulated sunlight is transmitted into a cavity from a transparent glass cover plate and irradiates on the upper surface of a solar cell, and even temperature distribution between the illuminated face and the shady face of the solar cell is guaranteed through cross ventilation above and below the solar cell. Simultaneously, temperatures of the illuminated face and the shady face of the solar cell are determined through a temperature determining device, through mutual matching of a heating device with a cooling device, temperatures at all positions of the solar cell can be maintained near a set test temperature value to guarantee the reliability of experimental data, and structural damages or functional invalidation caused by an over-large temperature difference between the illuminated face and the shady face of the solar cell and uneven heat of all positions is avoided.
