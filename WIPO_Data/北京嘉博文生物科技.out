The present invention relates to a composite microbial agent, a preparation method thereof and an application in the preprocessing of kitchen garbage. The active ingredients of the composite microbial agent include 15 percent to 30 percent of bacillus stearothermophilus, 10 percent to 25 percent of bacillus licheniformis, 10 percent to 25 percent of zymomonas, 10 percent to 25 percent of agrobacterium, 15 percent to 30 percent of saccharomyces cerevisiae and 10 percent to 25 percent of candida, which are blended together. The composite microbial agent is prepared according to the following method: (1) the strains, which are preserved under the temperature of 4 DEG C, are respectively inoculated in ordinary broth media, the inoculation amount is 0.1 percent (v/v), and under the temperature between 28 DEG C and 37 DEG C, activating culture lasts for 8 to 18 hours; (2) the strains are then respectively transinoculated into ordinary broth media to be cultured for 8 to 18 hours under the temperature between 28 DEG C and 34 DEG C, the inoculation amount is between 0.1 percent (v/v) and 0.5 percent (v/v), and after culturing, microbial liquids are blended according to the proportion. The composite microbial agent can be used to preprocess kitchen garbage, inhibit the reproduction of pathogenic microorganisms in the kitchen garbage and reduce the deterioration and stink of the kitchen garbage, so that the kitchen garbage can be conveniently processed later, so the application prospect of the composite microbial agent is wide.
