The invention relates to a charging method of SaaS (software as a service) software, which is characterized in that: software charge category, a pricing factor and charging strategy are preferentially configured, and charging setting is carried out; the attribute relevant to the charging is typed-in according to the source of charges; and then the charge type is calculated according to the input value configuration and the charge is calculated, and finally, the charge calculating result is displayed; therefore, only the relevant charge category, the pricing factor and the charging strategy are needed to be configured, and individual development is not needed aiming at the charge mode of the soft ware; meanwhile, the charge mode and rules for the same software are needed to be changed, and only the corresponding rules are needed to be modified; besides, immediate effect of immediate charge can be realized; more importantly, by combining simple soft charge configuration, a nonprofessional person can carry out the procedures easily, therefore, the soft maintaining cost is reduced.

The invention relates to an interface method suitable for Software as a Service (SaaS) software, which is characterized by comprising the following steps of: firstly, coding messages related to the SaaS software in a uniform message format; secondly, deserializing the messages by means of a uniform interface processing logic to form specific internal message objects; next, calling different operation processing logics to process the message objects so that the external release forms of the messages are unrelated to the specific processing logics of the messages; then fully decoupling the external release forms of the messages from the specific processing logics of the messages in a factory pattern; and finally, when a new external interface interaction way is needed to be added, adding a logic of obtaining the messages associated with the interaction way, thereby establishing an interface. In this way, through the design and establishment of a uniform message standard, the external interface of a SaaS software access component can be standardized so that lots of operations can be all processed by means of the same interface; and for an independent software provider, the technical difficulty is reduced and the release workload is also reduced.

The invention discloses a threshold and key-based authorization method in software as a service (SaaS), which is a solution of data security in application of enhancement software as a service (SaaS). The authorization method is mainly used for providing objective security insurance for an SaaS user from technical means so as to solve the problems in protecting data security of SaaS enterprise users. By using the authorization method provided by the invention, a very good method can be naturally provided for solving SaaS security problems. The authorization method is a strategic method, and in the method, keys are divided and an SaaS client masters part of the keys so that an SaaS software provider and an SaaS operator cannot perform certain advanced data operation without the participation of the SaaS client. The authorization method aims to convert key authentication of the client into client authorization, thereby improving security information of the user, and increasing the safety insurance.
