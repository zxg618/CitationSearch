The invention relates to a formula and a preparation process of aztreonam for injection. The preparation process comprises the following steps of: preparing; removing pyrogen; degerming, namely, filtering a prepared liquid medicament with a 0.22 mu m grade filter membrane within 8 hours for degerming; filling, namely, filling the degermed liquid medicament into a small bottle within 8 hours; performing freeze drying, namely, transferring the small bottle filled with the liquid medicament onto a shelf board of a freeze dryer, pre-freezing at the temperature of 40 DEG C below zero for 2 to 3 hours, setting the temperature of the shelf board to be between 0 and 8 DEG C at a primary drying stage, setting the vacuum degree to be between 5 and 15 Pa and drying for about 19 hours until the temperature of the product is close to the set temperature; and setting the temperature of the shelf board to be between 30 and 40 DEG C at a secondary drying stage, setting the vacuum degree to be between 5 and 15 Pa, drying for 3 to 5 hours until the temperature of the product is more than 25 DEG C, restoring the pressure of a freeze drying box to atmospheric pressure, compressing a bottle plug and removing the small bottle from the freeze drier. The preparation process has the advantages of short period, low energy consumption and the like.
