The invention discloses a three-dimensional animation producing method and a material independently exporting and importing method. The material independently exporting and importing method comprises a material exporting step: A1, quoting a model file in a three-dimensional animation scene, and adjusting and endowing a material; A2, selecting a model to be exported, wherein the material of the model is displayed in a plugin list; A3, selecting the material needing to be exported in the list, wherein the plugin inquires and provides detailed associated information of the material and exports a storage position of the material; A4, selecting proper exporting way and postfix; and A5, exporting the material to a specific position, then the material exporting step is finished, wherein the material of the model independently exists in a .ma file; and the connection information of the model and the material independently exist in a .shl file. The material independently exporting and importing method in a three-dimensional animation producing process provided by the invention can be applied to massive rendering and files of routine work and is simply unified into one set; the maintenance for each link is simplified; and lots of time is saved.

The invention discloses a method for producing large-scale groups in a three-dimensional animation production process, which comprises the following steps: A, creating a plane; B, creating a particle emitter on the plane, wherein the particle emitter is used for generating a plurality of particles and each particle represents an individual in the groups; C, drawing a generating area of the particles, wherein the particles appear in the area according to set parameters; D, drawing a path of the particles, wherein the particles move according to the set drawn path; E, repeating the steps B, C and D, and creating a plurality of groups of crowds on the plane created by the step A; and F, randomly substituting a loop animation of group movement with the particles and adjusting the parameters according to needs. The method for producing the large-scale groups in the three-dimensional animation production process can adjust the large-scale groups which are high in degree of realism and can deal with complicated scenes.
