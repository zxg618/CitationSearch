The invention discloses a method and a device for generating two-dimensional images. The method includes: generating a map according to the geometrical shape of a three-dimensional model and a corresponding texture map, wherein the map stores the corresponding relation between the texture map and the geometrical shape of a two-dimensional image projected by the three-dimensional model; and inputting the texture map to render the map so as to generate the two-dimensional image. When the map is generated, the three-dimensional model is projected by a camera model of pinhole imaging, the coordinate of the texture map is directly obtained during projecting, the intensity of corresponding texture points is processed by the aid of an illumination model, and transparency of the corresponding texture points is processed by designing a learning strategy of two-step projection. The corresponding relation between the geometrical shape of the two-dimensional mapped image and the texture map can be well maintained, different final images can be rendered conveniently by changing different texture maps, flexibility is improved greatly, and the network bandwidth is further saved by only transmitting the texture map as compared with that of the prior art by transmitting the whole character animation sequence.
