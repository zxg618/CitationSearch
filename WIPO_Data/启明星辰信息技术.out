The technology is characterized in that attack event information is correlated with target host information on the base of capturing suspicious intrusion event to judge the effectiveness of the attack event. The information of a protected host can be defined on two ways, anthropogenic input or introducing the scanning result. Weather an intrusion event can result in intrusion to the target host is judged according to the open port, operation system and existing leak information of the target host, thus the reported intrusion event can be filtered for precisely alarming. Weather an intrusion event should be displayed is judged according to the precisely alarming filtering result, thus the interference of ineffective event can be eliminated and the NIDS false alarm rate can be reduced.

The invention relates to a trans-system software upgrading method which belongs to the software technology field, comprising the steps of: defining the upgrading instruction file, making the upgrading package using the packing program on the novel-edition software system, executing the upgrading process on the system to be upgraded, reading the upgrading package and checking the integrity, validity and adaptability of the package, upgrading in terms of the package information which probably includes the adding, deleting, changing, starting or stopping of the process or the restart of the system and recording and baking up the system state changed by each operation step, outputting the upgrading result, if any abnormality occurs, the system will be restored to the pre-upgrade state; or else the edition information will be updated and the back up information will be deleted. The upgrading process supports roll-back function, thereby the soft system can be ensured at the utmost to retreat to the original state when the upgrading fails.

This invention is based on the time and events sequence to analysis attacking detection methods and devices involved in exchange for the function of the network. It is a methods and devices to prevent removing data from the data transmission channel without permission .The method provides a complex text-based attack description language to make the user can amend the built-related characteristics, and add new features of related events. The present invention include: basic rules of the incident, the rules of the association, first level detection engine, correlation analysis engine. The whole process of attacking are described more comprehensive and reasonable taking into account the time factor and the order of events Such description and testing which distinct the basic incidents more carefully are more in line with the requirements of detecting attacks. The invention also describes the relation between alarm incident and not alarm incident.

The invention relates to smart agreement analytical methods and devices used for intruding detection defense (IDS / IPS) and audit products. The purpose of the invention is to provide an agreement not to rely solely on the static ports and matching agreement characteristics of intelligent field protocol analysis technology and analytical format of the agreement is automatically adjusted in different versions of the software and gives accurate results, which enhanced the accuracy of the analysis of the agreement. The invention consists of three major steps: the establishment of agreements features model; agreement recognition; intelligent analysis of that agreement. This invention solved the traditional IDS / IPS products for the non-standard ports or did not have static characteristics of field data packet network protocol identification of problems but for some applications or different versions of the agreement, such as the reasons for the analytical results can provide automated error rectification work.

The invention relates to a network security audit system, and a security audit method based on role management. Wherein, the invention is characterized in that: based on detecting network data and the audit strategy of role, it audits the access on main body, protects the object, and records the TCP conversation based on the rules set by manager, to support following analysis. The invention can defines trust user, trust sub network and certificate user, and appoints the protected host and protected service, sets the access rule based on the application layer protocol, and sets angle based on the control need of resource access, packs the defined access rule into role, and appoints the angle to defined user.
