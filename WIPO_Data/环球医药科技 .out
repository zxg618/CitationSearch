A technique is provided for processing image data (34) based upon determination of whether pixilated data tends to represent or exhibit one characteristic or another. Many such characteristics may be considered, such as whether the pixels probably represent structures (54) or non-structures (56). Multiple thresholds for the classification of segmentation are used, and pixels falling within an overlapping regions are processed as if they exhibited both characteristics. Subsequent processing may include assignment of values for the overlapping pixels (58), such as by weighted blending.

To improve the ratio of a contrast agent to a tissue in imaging the tissue in which the contrast agent is injected. The contrast agent having microbubbles of fundamental frequency is injected into a subject. A first transmit pulse 136 and a second transmit pulse 144 are transmitted into the body of the subject. The first and second transmit pulses respectively include first (fundamental) signals 130, 138 and second (seed) signals 132, 140. The fundamental signals have frequency based on the fundamental frequency, and the seed signals have subharmonic frequency based on the frequency of the fundamental signal. The first and second transmit pulses are inverted in phases. Echoes 184, 186 received from the first and second transmit pulses are subjected to filtering with a subharmonic or superhamonic frequency to eliminate tissue response and pass the microbubble response.

Using the image data representing the process that contrast medium permeates into the main body in the order of time, a permeated area image data generating unit (210) generates the permeated area image data representing the image in all the areas in which contrast medium permeates, and a permeation process image data generating unit (220) generates the permeation process image data representing the process of permeation in the order of time. An synthesizing/outputting unit (230) superposes all the images represented by the permeation process image data on an image represented by the permeated area image data, and sends the result images to a display unit (109) orderly. Compared with all the area in which the contrast medium permeates, the permeation process that the contrast medium permeates into the visible part can be identified. In particular, the change and the increase in time order of the area number in which the contrast medium permeates can be detected.

The optical mask layer, which may extend along the x-axis, z-axis, or both, is designed to absorb and/or reflect light emitted the scintillators 57 of the scintillator array 56. Through this absorption and/or reflection, transference of light photons from a scintillator to the photodiode corresponding to a neighboring scintillator is reduced. This reduction in cross-talk reduces artifacts in a reconstructed image and therefore improves the diagnostic value of the image.

A B.sub.0 magnetic field map for each scan slice of a scan volume is obtained from the B.sub.0 magnetic field distribution in the scan volume. The B.sub.0 magnetic field maps are used to calculate the median value of the B.sub.0 magnetic field over each scan slice. A first frequency of RF pre-pulses is obtained by a standard procedure. A second frequency of RF pre-pulses is then calculated for each scan slice by adding the median value of the B.sub.0 magnetic field over the scan slice to the first frequency of RF pre-pulses. Thereafter RF pre-pulses at the second frequency is applied to the scan slice.

The transmitter/receiver for a convex probe and linear probe are used to drive a sector probe. Usually, when an ultrasound diagnostic apparatus using a convex probe and linear probe uses a sector probe, it selects vibration elements of N in number, which is equal to the number of channels of the sector probe, out of vibration elements of L in number (N is smaller than L), so that the selected elements are distributed at a virtually constant pitch in the alignment of vibration elements, and turns on only high voltage switches which are connected with the selected vibration elements to implement the sector scanning with the transmitter/receiver. It becomes possible to implement the sector scanning by using the transmitter/receiver having channels less than the number of vibration elements of the sector probe.

The insulating material (13) of the HV insulating system (11) for an unipolar X-ray device (10) comprises a central portion (56) of nearly conical shape on the upper face (50) and a flat surface on which the HV contact (76) receives a spring biasing pin (76) from an HV connector (17) on the lower face (62). The outer edge parts (66) with flange on the upper face (50) and the lower face (62) are connected to the HV connector (17). The upper face forms an inverse conically shaped central channel (52) that receives the HV conductor (54) which is coaxial with the central portion of the nearly conical shape (56). The nearly conically shaped central portion (56) further forms the inverse conically shaped central channel (52) so that the base part (58) of the inverse conically shaped central channel (52) may be formed at the tilting crowning (60) of the nearly conical shape central portion (56).

The contrast-to-tissue ratio is improved while imaging contrast infused tissue. A subject is infused with contrast medium having microbubbles at a fundamental frequency. First and second transmit pulses are transmitted into the subject. The first and second transmit pulses each comprise first, or basic, and second, or seed, signals. The basic signal has a frequency based on the fundamental frequency and the seed signal has a subharmonic frequency based on the frequency of the basic signal. The first and second transmit pulses are phase inverted with respect to each other. Received echoes from first and second transmit pulses are filtered at a subharmonic or ultraharmonic frequency to remove tissue response and pass microbubble response.

For the purpose of preventing noticeable interleave blocks on a display screen, when a number of packets P is defined, P (>=2) ultrasonic pulse transmissions are conducted in one direction to acquire one acoustic line signal. At that time, if a number of interleaves I is defined, the ultrasonic pulse transmissions in the one direction are each interleaved with ultrasonic pulse transmissions for acquiring (I-1) acoustic line signals that belong to (I-1) frames different from the frame to which the former acoustic line signal belongs.

A method and apparatus in an ultrasound imaging system is disclosed that enhances the contrast-to-tissue ratio and signal-to-noise ratio of contrast imaging using stepped-chirp waveforms. The first waveform component is employed with a first frequency optimized to initiate the bubble dynamics and the second waveform component is employed with a second frequency optimized to produce an enhanced bubble nonlinear response. The first waveform component and the at least a second waveform component are transmitted as a single stepped-chirp transmit pulse. At least one of a center frequency, an amplitude, a starting phase, and a bandwidth of the waveform components are adjusted to generate the single stepped-chirp transmit pulse. A relative phase, a switch time, and a time delay between the waveform components are also adjusted for maximal enhancement of bubble nonlinear response.
