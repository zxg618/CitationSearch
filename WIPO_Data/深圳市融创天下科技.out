The invention discloses a video decoding method, a video decoding device and a video/audio play system. By setting an output frame queue buffer zone in both a video decoding module and an audio decoding module to trade space for time, an echo module and the decoding module can work asynchronously. Specifically speaking, if the frame queue buffer zone has video/audio frame data, echo is performed by directly acquiring data from a buffer queue according to a play speed rather than waiting for the output of a decoder. Because the decoding of video 1 frame takes relatively long time, in order to guarantee that the echo module does not stop due to the lack of dispatched CPU, the method uses entropy decoding in a video decoding process and CPU scheduling after motion compensation to ensure echo module can call the CPU in time, thereby guaranteeing playing smoothness and fluency. Therefore, when calculation decoding resources provided by a processor are narrowly enough, the phenomenon of unbalance or incoherence of video/audio play can be eliminated, and smooth and fluent play effect and more precise video/audio synchronization are provided.

The invention relates to the field of video image processing and provides an image processing method of a self-adaptive time domain and spatial domain resolution ratio frame. The method comprises the following steps: A. an encoder computes and obtains the conditional value of the critical code rate according to the variation of an input video image and a target distribution code rate; B. the encoder compares the conditional value and the threshold value of the critical code rate; if the conditional value of the critical code rate is less than the threshold value, i.e. when the target distribution code rate is less than the critical code rate, the image resolution ratio which is adaptive to the target distribution code rate is obtained through the under-sampling; otherwise, the conventional coding processing is carried out; and C. the encoder recovers and receives the original resolution rate of the image through the upsampling and carries out the conventional coding processing. The method does not cause that the imaged decoded by the encoder produces serious distortion caused by the over-compression or over-quantization of the encoder in the situation of ensuring the low code rate.
