The invention relates to a reply processing platform after active hang-up of a mobile phone and a service method thereof. The platform comprises a signalling processing sub-system, a service processing sub-system, a database sub-system, an interface computer sub-system, a WEB server sub-system, a client sub-system and a firewall sub-system, wherein the signalling processing sub-system, the service processing sub-system and the database sub-system are connected to a platform exchanger. The signalling processing sub-system and the database sub-system are used for completing calling switch-in, and the service processing sub-system descends a service selection menu to a called user by a USSD system through the interface computer sub-system and completes logic judgment according to user feedback information. The service method of the reply processing platform comprises the following steps: playing a voice to a calling party transferred from the platform by the reply processing platform after the called user actively hangs up; judging the attribute of a user card simultaneously; selecting the USSD system or a short message system to descend the menu for the method for processing hang-up of the current calling to the called user; and providing the subsequent service by the reply processing platform according to the user selection.

The invention relates to a method used for quickly matching short message texts and is characterized in that the short message text needed to be matched is partitioned as fragments by Chinese and English punctuations such as 'comma,pause mark and full stop'; subsequently, Hash value is calculated for the fragments by a Hash arithmetic; when the matching is carried out, the Hash values of all fragments of the source short message text and the Hash values of all fragments of destination short message texts are compared with each other, thus controlling the output matching results by similarity; the method not only improves the tracking and matching efficiency, but also can meet the matching requirement of massive short message call lists and has good practical values.
