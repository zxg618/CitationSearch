The invention provides a preparation method for endocyclic dicyclopentadiene and a device thereof. The method comprises the following steps: raw materials dicyclopentadiene enter a polymerization reactor to be heated to 20 DEG C to 45 DEG C to carry out polymerization reaction; the materials are forced to circulate in a polymerization process with the polymerization reaction time for 3 to 24 h; and the endocyclic dicyclopentadiene is obtained after the reaction is completed. A kettle body of the polymerization reactor is connected in series with a force circulation device; and the force circulation device comprises a force circulation pump and a honeycomb duct, and is connected with the kettle body through the honeycomb duct. In the polymerization reaction, a mode of forcing the materialsto circulate is adopted, the polymerization temperature in the polymerizer can be kept to be uniform, the materials slowly react, the polymerization reaction basically can not generate ring hanging type dicyclopentadiene under the reaction conditions, and the content of the endocyclic dicyclopentadiene in a prepared polymerization reaction product reaches more than 99 percent.

The invention relates to a method for extracting and separating diolefins from C5 hydrocarbons by solvent circulation and azeotropic dehydration, pertaining to the preparation technology of extracting and separating isoprene from DMF. The invention is characterized in that: by employing a single tower, materials are sent into an extracting tower (1) from a feed port (6); at the temperature of 90-120 DEG C and tower top pressure of 0.02MPa, the azeotropic dehydration is carried out; and then the obtained material is taken out of a discharge port (7). In the process of employing the DMF method to separate diolefins from C5 components, the azeotropic dehydration method is adopted, which ensures that water containing in the extracting circulation solvent meet requirement; the water content is less than 500PPm, thus lowering the investment of equipment by reducing a tower system and an attachment heat exchanger, a machine pump and a liquid curing tank, and technology control difficulty is reduced; besides, the invention can guarantee that the water content in the circulation solvent meets requirements and the process of C5 separation can be carried out smoothly.

The invention belongs to the fine chemical field, which is mainly used for the synthesis of rubber accelerator NS and the intermediate raw material of the rifampicin-tert-butylamine. The invention is characterized in that: the methyl tert-butyl ether-hydrocyanic acid method is adopted to produce tert-butylamine; under normal pressure, the methyl tert-butyl ether is added with hydrocyanic acid and is added with concentrated sulphuric acid to carry out fully catalytic reaction; the methanol produced in the catalytic reaction is fully adopted and is added with water to perform hydrolysis, deep hydrolysis and esterification, and methyl formate and methanol without react completely are distilled; sulphates in calcium hydroxide solution and the butylamine to replace the butylamine to gain the butylamine through rectification and produce the byproduct calcium sulfate. The invention adopts the water instead of the methanol to carry out the hydrolysis and esterification and neutralizes the raw materials and adopts the calcium hydroxide to produce butylamine, which has the advantages of simple process, short production period, high yield, stable product quality, low production cost and small environment pollution.
