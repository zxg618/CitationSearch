A tracking method of human body motions and an identification method thereof are disclosed. The tracking method includes the following steps: providing a continuous and multi-frame dynamic image and establish a background based on the dynamic image; simultaneously performing a pretreatment and a human body position process on every frame of the image so as to acquire and output human body position information of the frame. The identification method includes the following steps: arranging a human body identification mode, such as a mouse mapping mode, a state mode, a motion mode and the like; identifying the human body position information of the every frame based on the human body identification mode and outputting the identification information. By using the methods of the invention, a video can be tracked continuously, high-accurately and real-timely for the every frame and the human body position information can be output. Especially, the methods can be used to tracking the motions of small face sport organs, such as eyes, a mouth and face muscles and motions of an upper limb part with a large motion amplitude, a high frequency and complex motion characteristics. Simultaneously, attitude information, such as a mouse position, a mouse movement, single click, double click, hands position, a left hand movement from left to right and the like, can be identified and output.

The invention belongs to the technical field of human motion tracking, and discloses a joint positioning method of single-view unmarked human motion tracking. The method comprises the following steps of: detecting the position of a hand, and acquiring handCandidate which is {Hi (xi, yi)}, wherein i is 0, 1, ..., numHandCandidate-1, Hi (xi, yi) is the candidate of the ith hand, and numHandCandidate is the number of the hand candidates; screening the position of the hand, and acquiring the candidates with high probability as optimal candidates; detecting the position of an elbow, and acquiring candidates of the elbow; compositely screening the positions of the hand and the elbow; combining every two optimal candidates of the hand and the elbow to form front arm candidates, and performing optimization on the front arm candidates to acquire an optimal front arm candidate; compositely screening the positions of the hand, the elbow and a shoulder, and performing composite optimization according to the optimal front arm candidate and the position of the shoulder to acquire an arm sample; and performing optimization weighing on the arm candidates to acquire final positions of the hand, the elbow and the shoulder. The method can be widely applied to human tracking and positioning.

The invention discloses a human face characteristic comparison method. The method comprises the following steps of: tracking a human face to acquire characteristic points and extracting detailed human face characteristic data; comparing human faces, namely comparing the human face characteristic data with the characteristic data of each human face in a human face database to acquire the similarity; judging whether a matched face has been found, wherein delta is a similarity threshold value; if Smax is more than delta, judging that the input face is matched with the face k' in the database; judging whether an expression is changed obviously or not; performing analysis according to continuous multi-frame human face characteristic points which comprise but not limited to the opening and the closing of a mouth and the opening and the closing of eyes; and judging whether the human face expression is changed obviously or not and outputting the compared human face. The human face characteristic comparison method belongs to the technical field of biological feature identification, is applied to human face tracking and comparison and is widely applied to various human face comparison systems.
