The method adopts phenol, methanal, the cardanol, auxiliary agent and hydrochloric acid to have reaction; the pH value of a reaction system is controlled to be within the range of 1.5-2.0, the temperature is slowly raised to 80-90DEG C, and then heating is stopped; the heat of the reaction is released untilthe temperature of the reaction system is 100 DEG C, and the reactant begins to boil; and after heat preservation reaction is stabilized for 2-3h, decompression dehydration can be carried out, so that the phenolic resin can be obtained. The performance of the modified phenolic resin can be measured under the experiment condition, the softening point is 82-90 DEG C, the flowing degree is 2.9-5.0cm, the polymerization speed is 60-90S, the viscosity is 12-15mpa*s, and the temperature is 25DEG C. The method can greatly reduce the manufacturing cost of the phenolic resin, so that the phenolic resin has good market prospect. The phenolic resin is environment-friendly and has no volatile component, thus being successfully applied to the coating industry by consumers. Furthermore, the method improves the inoxidizability and the heat resistance of the phenolic resin.

The invention discloses a method for preparing a high-purity cardanol. The method comprises a process of extracting a cardanol from a natural cashew nut shell liquid with a molecular still, wherein the molecular still consists of a cylindrical shell, a rotor and a built-in condenser, the lower part of the cylindrical shell is provided with a heater, a fixed frame is provided with a film blade and an antispray device; the natural cashew nut shell liquid is poured into the cylindrical shell from the top and the rotor is rotated between the cylindrical shell and the condenser at the same time to distribute the natural cashew nut shell liquid on a heating surface of the cylindrical shell continuously and evenly; and the film blade is used to spread the feed liquid to a layer of turbostratic liquid film and the film blade is used to spirally push the turbostratic liquid film to the built-in condenser to cool the turbostratic liquid film into a liquid; finally the liquid flows down along a pipe of the condenser and is discharged from a discharge pipe to obtain the high-purity cardanol. The method can improve the yield and purity of the cardanol.

The invention relates to a low-viscosity cardanol epoxy resin curing agent which has a structural formula shown on the right. The method for preparing the low-viscosity cardanol epoxy resin curing agent utilizes reaction of cardanol, p/m-benzene dimethylamine and paraformaldehyde to prepare the low-viscosity cardanol epoxy resin curing agent. The low-viscosity cardanol epoxy resin curing agent has no solvent, has no irritation, is nontoxic and environment-friendly, is mild in heat release, low in color, low in viscosity, and moderate in curing speed, can be cured at a low temperature, and simultaneously has superior anti-corrosive and protective properties; and cured products have superior toughness, good strength, superior adhesion and invasive ability on substrates, and superior low surface construction performance, and are normally used on wet and rusty surfaces.
