The invention discloses a high-efficiency agricultural greenhouse cultivation and fertilizer water recycling method. The method comprises the following steps: piling soil to form a ridge and covering the ridge with PE film; placing substrate cultivation bags or substrate cultivation grooves on the PE film; establishing a fertilizer water irrigation recovery system, and arranging a fertilization pipe and a waste liquid recovery pipe on the ridge. The waste liquid recovery pipe is arranged under the PE film, and the fertilization pipe is communicated with the substrate cultivation bags or the substrate cultivation grooves; the waste liquid recovery pipe is connected with a fertilizer water recovery pool, and a pumping system is arranged in a fertilizer preparation pool; and the fertilization pipe is connected with the pumping system. The cultivation substrate does not contact the soil directly and can keep the temperature of the cultivation substrate substantially equal the soil temperature; the fertilizer water irrigation recovery system is established, which realizes full efficient utilization of the fertilizer water, effectively solves the problem of non-point pollution resulting from protected agricultural production and has the advantages of convenient operation, reproducibility and low construction cost.
