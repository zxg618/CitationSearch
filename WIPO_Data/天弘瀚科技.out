The present invention belongs to the field of optical functional material technology, and is especially preparation process of SiO2/PMMA-based light scattering molded material. SiO2 precursor is dissolved into PMMA base to be polymerized; the PMMA base containing SiO2 precursor is then swelled in some solution, so that water molecule is diffused into the PMMA base to hydrolyze the SiO2 precursor, to in-situ produce SiO2 microcrystal with SiO2 chemically combined with the PMMA base and to form the optical scattering composite material. The optical scattering composite material is further pelletized to produce the light scattering molded material. Both the optical scattering composite material and the light scattering molded material have light conducting and diffusing functions, homogeneous scattering and high stability, and may be applied widely in display and lighting fields.

The invention relates to a light function material technical field, in particular to a production of light-scattering conductive plate and a relative conductive plate. The method comprises that first, synthesizing a light-scattering composite material which contains SiO2 micro crystal and PMMA base connected via chemical bonds, then preparing a light-scattering conductive plate that mixing the light-scattering composite material with a MMA pre-aggregate liquid, via irrigating method to prepare the light-scattering conductive plate, or mixing the light-scattering material with a PMMA resin uniformly, via extruding method or injection method to prepare the light-scattering conductive plate. The inventive light-scattering conductive plat has high brightness, better uniformity, high light convert efficiency, high temperature resistance, long service life, and wide application in advertisement, display or the like.
