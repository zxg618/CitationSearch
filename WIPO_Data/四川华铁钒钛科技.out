The invention relates to a method for preparing anatase nano titania, which relates to the chemical product preparation technical field. The method adopts a metatitanic acid produced by the sulfuric acid method as a raw material; depolymerizing agents are added into the metatitanic acid and reacted with a sulfuric acid in the metatitanic acid so as to depolymerize the metatitanic acid; micron secondary agglomerated particles of the metatitanic acid are depolymerized into nano primary positive particles; and anatase nano titania products are prepared with low cost after subsequent procedure treatments of gel coagulation, filtration, washing, calcination, crushing and so on of the processed metatitanic acid. The method has a simple technique and the anatase nano titania is high in purity; and the three wastes are small in amount and convenient to recover, and no emission of waste gas and liquor can be reached completely, thereby the complete environment-friendly industrial standard can be realized. Moreover, the method can manyfold reduce the manufacturing cost of the nano titania products, thereby having great promotion value and wide market prospect.

The invention relates to a method for preparing titania raw materials with high specific surface area used by denitration catalyst, which relates to the chemical product preparation technical field. The method comprises the following steps that: a metatitanic acid produced by adoption of the sulfuric acid method is processed by an organic surfactant and then modified so as to reduce the viscosity of the metatitanic acid; and loose titania products with high specific surface area and high surface chemical activity used by the denitration catalyst are prepared through filtration and calcination of the processed metatitanic acid. The method has a simple technique for processing the metatitanic acid and has low cost; and added organic substances are fully decomposed during the calcining stage, thereby impurities can not be brought into the final products and the environmental pollution can not be caused.
