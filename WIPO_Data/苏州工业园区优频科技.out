The invention relates to a real time positioning system and belongs to the field of communication technology. The real time positioning system is characterized by comprising a positioning label, a positioning mark, a wireless network access point, and a management server, wherein the positioning label is arranged on an object or personnel which need to be positioned and tracked; the positioning mark is arranged on a fixed reference point; communication and measurement are performed among the positioning mark, the positioning label and the wireless network access point by using a wireless network; the wireless network access point is connected with the management server through the internet; and the management server calculates the position of the positioning label according to the received information. Thus, due to the reasonable use of the positioning mark, the positioning accuracy is greatly improved on the premise of no substantial increase of system cost. Besides, as the positioning mark only needs to realize a simple function of periodic sending, both the power consumption and the cost of the positioning mark are greatly decreased compared with an AP. In most cases, a battery or solar energy can be used for supplying power to the positioning mark, so no power supply wiring and network wiring are needed.
