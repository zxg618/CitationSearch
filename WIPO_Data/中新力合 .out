PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To solve problems that in a conventional apparatus for producing resin-based modifiers, the cross sectional shape of a combustion cylinder 2 is circular, and combustion is good by suitable intake of oxygen in the outer peripheral part of the combustion cylinder, but the larger the size of the combustion cylinder becomes, the more difficult the combustion becomes due to difficulty of oxygen supply in the central part. SOLUTION: The apparatus for producing resin-based modifiers in which a combustion furnace is arranged in the inside of an enclosure, part of a synthetic resin waste material arranged in the combustion furnace is burned, and the other synthetic resin waste material is melted and pyrolyzed to produce a waxy material is characterized in that the combustion furnace has a cross-sectional shape having a short side and a long side, wherein the short side is 10-40 cm. Accordingly, the central part of the combustion furnace has a short distance from the long side, and the combustion in the central part of the combustion furnace can be performed in a good condition.

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To solve problems, wherein in a conventional apparatus for manufacturing a resin-based modifier, (i) since the thrown-in whole waste material burns at once, the control of burning is difficult, (ii) since air is introduced from a large number of air introducing apertures 2b formed at the side wall of a basket 2 for firing, the control of burning is difficult, and the like. SOLUTION: The apparatus for manufacturing a resin-based modifier, in which a combustion furnace is arranged in the inside of an enclosure, a portion of a plastic waste material arranged in this combustion furnace is burned, and other plastic waste material is melted and pyrolyzed to manufacture a waxy material, is characterized in that in the combustion furnace, the upper part and the upper part of the side are closed, the lower part and the lower part of the side are opened to the extent that does not carry out the natural fall of the plastic waste material arranged in the combustion furnace, and a portion of the plastic waste material is made to burn in the side and the lower part which are opened. Thereby, the plastic waste material is gradually burned from the lower edge. COPYRIGHT: (C)2008,JPO&INPIT

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To solve the problems of conventional apparatuses for producing a resin-based modifying agent by dropping a molten waxy material from the bottom of a combustion furnace and collecting the material in a reservoir tank placed under the furnace, comprising lowering the quality of the produced modifying agent because the resin-based modifying agent stored in the reservoir tank is contaminated with impurities such as soot generated in a combustion basket or carbon black in a waste synthetic resin. SOLUTION: A molten waxy material dropped from a combustion furnace is received once with water and a resin-based modifying agent is recovered from the water. The contamination of the modifying agent with impurities such as soot generated by combustion and carbon black is prevented by the method and the modifying agent and the impurity are present as separate individual materials to enable easy separation of the agent. Accordingly, the obtained resin-based modifying agent has high purity. COPYRIGHT: (C)2008,JPO&INPIT

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To solve problems in which it is required to use separately prepared reactive material and other process for acid modification in addition to production of a non-oxidative type is required and polyethylene wax cannot be produced inexpensively and simply, because oxidative type polyethylene wax is produced by adding an organic peroxide compound (reaction initiator) such as DCP and a carboxylic acid compound such as phthalic anhydride to the melt of non-oxidative type polyethylene wax to carry out chemical reaction, substituting or grafting a hydrogen group of a part of polyethylene structure with an oxidation compound and introducing a carboxyl group into the structure to carry out acid modification. SOLUTION: A method for producing polyethylene wax comprises passing through a process for previously carrying out heat-oxidative degradation of crosslinked polyethylene and burning and pyrolyzing the treated crosslinked polyethylene. As a result, oxidation type polyethylene wax can readily be produced without requiring to use separately prepared reactive material. COPYRIGHT: (C)2007,JPO&INPIT

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To solve a problem, in a manufacturing method of an oxidized polyethylene-based modifier comprising adding an organic peroxide compound (a reaction initiator) such as DCP and a carboxylic acid compound such as phthalic anhydride to melt of a non-oxidized polyethylene-based modifier thereby causing them to chemically react to replace a part of hydrogen moieties of the polyethylene structure with an oxidized compound or to graft the oxidized compound thereonto thereby introducing a carboxyl group into (acid-modifying) the structure, that inexpensive and simple manufacture of the modifier is impossible because it is necessary to use a reaction material prepared separately and because another step is necessary for the acid modification other than the step for the manufacture of the non-oxidized modifier. SOLUTION: An ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymer (EEA) or a crosslinked polyethylene waste material comprising EEA among covering layer resins of power cables or the like as waste materials is employed as the raw material. The oxidized polyethylene-based modifier is readily manufactured by merely burning and pyrolyzing the raw material. COPYRIGHT: (C)2007,JPO&INPIT

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To solve a problem, in a manufacturing method of a resin-based modifier comprising burning a synthetic resin waste material in an oxygen-deficient state to cause a part of the rest of the synthetic resin waste material to melt or pyrolyze by the combustion heat to obtain the resin-based modifier, that combustion residue accumulates on the rooster with the lapse of combustion time and the other raw materials are buried in the combustion residue resulting in discontinuation of the combustion of the raw materials and a problem that the resin modifier cannot be efficiently manufactured because the formed wax-like melt mixes with the combustion residue to cause deterioration in qualities of the resin-based modifier and because the formed wax-like melt is absorbed in the combustion residue or absorbed and further disappears. SOLUTION: The synthetic resin waste material is molten or pyrolyzed with its longitudinal direction maintained perpendicular. Thus, the molten wax-like melt is separated in the cross section to permit efficient manufacture of the resin-based modifier of good qualities. COPYRIGHT: (C)2007,JPO&INPIT
