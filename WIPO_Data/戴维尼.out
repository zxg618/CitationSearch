The invention relates to a drag and drop search method, which is realized by providing a drag and drop search bar on a searched webpage. The upper and lower limit of data of search bar is to be captured in action. The scale of drag and drop search bar is distributed in accordance with data density of database. The invention can read dynamic data and assign the upper and lower limits of the drag and drop search bar, thus not having the situation that the search bar cannot be searched and the situation that redundant search conditions are incurred. An asynchronous interactive communicating mode is adopted to exchange data with a database, so even a mass of data can respond within a very short time. The drag and drop search method can provides users with the simplest search method, thus better catering to the need of the users.

The present invention relates to a method for recovering an organic-inorganic element-doped metal oxide from a hydrolysable metal compound, accompanied with contaminated water treatment. The present invention comprises steps of: a) adding a hydrolysable metal compound as a coagulant to a contaminated water to form a separable floc between the hydrolysable metal compound and contaminants present in contaminated water; b) separating the separable floc and the pre-treated water after flocculation treatment; and c) calcinating the separated floc over 500 DEG C to produce an organic-inorganic element-doped metal oxide. More preferably, the present invention further comprises subjecting the pre-treated water of the step b) to a microwave treatment to cause a photocatalytic degradation of an organic contaminant that remains in the pre-treated water, with the assistance of the remaining hydrolysable metal compound. A novel titanium compound is found as an alternative coagulant instead of iron and aluminum salts which most widely use in water treatment. Ability, capacity and efficiency of flocculation as the proposed titanium coagulant are similar to those of FeCl3 and alum coagulants in terms of removing organic matter. Titania produced by calcination of the separated floc after TiCl4 flocculation is mainly doped with C and P atoms.

A method of verifying the authenticity of goods is provided, wherein a set of public data (4, 6, 8) and security code (10) are applied to the goods (2), said security code having been derived from said public data by means of a predetermined encryption algorithm. Upon receiving a request for verification, the public data (4, 6, 8) applied to the goods (2) is entered into the predetermined encryption algorithm to generate a verification code. The verification code is then compared with the security code (10) applied to the goods to assess the authenticity of goods.

A communication antenna (10) having a driven element (16) extending between a feed point (13) and an attachment point (15) to a top loaded element in which the driven element (16) is longer than the shortest distance (P) between the feed point (13) and the attachment point (15), the driven element (16) being configured to follow a meandering path between the feed point (13) and the attachment point (15). The driven element (16) is at least in part in the form of straight sections joined to give a zigzag configuration (16). Alternatively the driven element (16) is at least in part in the form of curved sections. At least a pair of parasitic elements (18, 19) can be provided with the members of the pair (18, 19) being disposed on opposite sides of, and off-set from, the driven element (16) and parallel to a straight ling (P) linking the feed point (13) to the attachment point (15); the parasitic elements (18, 19) serving to provide impedance matching and increased bandwidth and providing shielding against radiation from the antenna in a predetermined direction. Typically passive elements can be incorporated with the parasitic elements (18, 19) to provide for the overall reduction in the size of the antenna (10).

High quality thin films of copper-indium-gallium-diselenide useful in the production of solar cells are prepared by electrodepositing at least one of the constituent metals (18) onto a glass/Mo substrate (12, 14), followed by physical vapor deposition of copper and selenium or indium and selenium to adjust the final stoichiometry of the thin film to approximately Cu(In,Ga)Se2. Using an AC voltage of 1-100 KHz in combination with a DC voltage for electrodeposition improves the morphology and growth rate of the deposited thin film. An electrodeposition solution comprising at least in part an organic solvent may be used in conjunction with an increased cathodic potential to increase the gallium content of the electrodeposited thin film.
