By using the variation of pixel value in a lung of a chest radiographic moving image due to heart beat, the variation information on the pixel value is effectively used for diagnosis such as of a lung embolism or a heart disease, considering the variation information as lung blood flow information. In a continuous X-ray image screening examination device (1), a chest X-ray moving image is received from an X-ray detector (2), and an electrocardiogram used as the original information on a heart beat variation is received from an electrocardiograph (5). From the dynamic state of the wall of the heart measured by the electrocardiograph or the chest X-ray moving image, the heart dynamic state during the cardiac chamber systolic and diastolic phases is grasped, and information such as the variation of the pixel value of the chest X-ray moving image due to increase (lung blood flow increase) of the blood flow from the heart to the lung during the cardiac chamber systolic phase.

[PROBLEM] To provide a small, low-cost, non-invasive bone density measuring device. [MEANS OF SOLVING PROBLEM] The measuring unit of a bone density measuring device comprises a light emitting unit (LED) (110) for emitting near infrared ray and a light reception unit (photodiode array) (120) for receiving it via a bone as an object of measuring. The light emitting unit (110) and the light reception unit (120) are connected with a control unit (140). The control unit (140) controls the light emission of the light emitting unit (110), and receives a measured value from the light reception unit (120) to display it as a bone density. Light reflected/scattered by a skin (132) and a bone (134) is detected by photodiodes (120) arranged in series. Remote photodiodes detect reflected/scattered lights reflecting the density characteristics of a bone at a deeper location without being affected by reflected/scattered lights from a skin. Bone density information only can be extracted by analyzing the spatial distribution of reflected/scattered light intensities obtained from photodiodes remote from the LED.

An X-ray diagnosis supporting apparatus, a program, and a storage medium for performing local quantitative evaluation of the function of, e.g., a lung to be examined and obtaining evaluation results effectively usable for image interpretation and diagnosis. A moving picture processing section (23) determines the movement amount by measuring the position of the diaphragm from a moving picture, specifies a moving picture of the maximum inspiration and a moving picture of the maximum expiration of CT images, and determines relative ventilation information for each divided breast area by using a pixel difference value. A CT image processing section (24) performs linear interpolation, creates a coronal image, a saggital image, and a raysum image, and measures the position of the diaphragm from the raysum image. An integrating section (25) aligns the frame of the moving picture having a respiration level equal to that of the CT image with the raysum image created from the CT image, and superimposes the ventilation information on the coronal image and the moving picture.

[PROBLEMS] To provide a small and inexpensive noninvasive bone density measuring device. [MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS] The measuring section of a bone density measuring device comprises a near infrared light emitting section (120) arranged in a holding body (110), and a light receiving section (130) for receiving light through a bone of measurement object. An arm is inserted, for example, into the holding body (110) and light absorption (absorbance) by the arm bone is measured thus measuring bone density. The light emitting section (120) and the light receiving section (130) are connected with a control section (140). The control section (140) controls emission from the light emitting section (120), receives a measurement from the light receiving section (130) and displays it as bone density. In order to remove the influence by light from the background or the difference in thickness of bone, ratio of absorbance between two wavelengths is preferably employed. Even when two light emitting elements (LEDs) are employed in order to obtain light having two wavelengths, two light emitting elements are allowed to emit light alternately and thereby only one light receiving element is required.
