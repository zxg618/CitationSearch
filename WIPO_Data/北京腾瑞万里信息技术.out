The invention provides a method for updating and displaying a navigation route of a real-time traffic status and a navigation server. The method comprises the following steps of: calculating the running distance of a mobile terminal which runs for a first preset period of time according to an acquired current optimal route; calculating a second period of time needed by the mobile terminal for running by the running distance according to the acquired current displayed route; and when the difference between the second period of time and the first preset period of time is more than a preset threshold, transmitting the current optimal route to the mobile terminal to update a current displayed route into a current optimal route by using the mobile terminal. Due to the adoption of the method for updating and displaying the navigation route of the real-time traffic status and the navigation server, the displayed navigation route is updated only when the current optimal route is remarkably superior to the current displayed route, the updating frequency of the navigation route is lowered, and valuable communication resource is saved.
