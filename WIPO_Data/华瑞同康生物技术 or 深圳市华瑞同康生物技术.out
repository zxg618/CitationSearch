The invention discloses a method for detecting 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG). The method comprises the following steps of: adding a 8-oxo-dG containing object to be detected into a solid-phase carrier; adding a 8-oxo-dG resistant antibody and making 8-oxo-dG react with the 8-oxo-dG resistant antibody to form a specific combination; adding an anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Immunoglobulin G-Horseradish Peroxidase) polymer and making the anti-mouse IgG-HRP polymer react with the specific combination to form a ternary compound containing the 8-oxo-dG, the 8-oxo-dG resistant antibody and the anti-mouse IgG-HRP polymer; adding an ECL (Electrochemical Luminescence) chemical luminous substrate which emits light under the action of the ternary compound; and detecting the luminous intensity of the ECL chemical luminous substrate and calculating the content of the 8-oxo-dG according to the luminous intensity. The method disclosed by the invention has the advantages of high yield, low detection limit, low cross reaction, easiness for operation, short detection time, no need of complex pretreatment or the adoption of any expensive instrument and low detection cost.
