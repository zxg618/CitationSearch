The invention discloses a login of slave equipment to primary equipment in a packet switch network. The slave equipment can not only back off for one login window in the case of sending a login request but also can back off for multiple login windows in the case of login conflict, and the back-off range of the login windows is exponentially increased with the increase of conflict frequency. As an improvement of the algorithm, the upper limit of the back-off range of the login windows can be defined to avoid the problem that the back-off time of the slave equipment is too long after multiple login conflicts. The method can reduce conflict probability and improve login efficiency in the cases of low uplink bandwidth and much slave equipment, so as to reduce the requirements for the size of the login window allocated by the primary equipment and the allocation frequency.

The invention discloses a method for judging uplink/downlink time. The method comprises the following steps: step 1, a local-terminal device transmits the time length information to a user-terminal device in a half duplex Ethernet over cable (EOC) network with fixed uplink/downlink time length, wherein the time length information contains one or more selected from the initial moments of uplink time and/or downlink time, the lengths of uplink time and/or downlink time, the stop moments of uplink time and/or downlink time and the length ratio of uplink time to downlink time; step 2, the user-terminal device receives and processes the time length information. The method for judging uplink/downlink time can allow the user-terminal device to automatically judge whether any moment belongs to the uplink or the downlink time in the half duplex EOC network with fixed uplink/downlink time. Usually, the network operator doesn't modify the length of uplink/downlink time frequently, and accordingly the method can allow the user-terminal device to judge the uplink/downlink time while occupying less network bandwidth.

The invention discloses a method for realizing single copy broadcasting of a coaxial cable-based packet switched network, including the steps that: first, in the coaxial cable-based packet switched network, a main device judges whether a downlink packet to be sent is a downlink broadcast packet; second, if the main judges that the downlink packet to be sent is a downlink broadcast packet, a broadcast identifier is taken along in the downlink broadcast packet and then the main device sends the downlink broadcast packet carrying the broadcast identifier only for one time to all the secondary devices; third, all the secondary devices receive and accept the downlink broadcast packet carrying the broadcast identifier. In the method, when downlink broadcasting is requested, the main device only needs to send the downlink broadcast packet to all the secondary devices once, and all the secondary devices will accept the packet both physically and logically, thus being called single cope broadcasting technology. The method can effectively improve the utilization efficiency of a network downlink bandwidth.

The invention discloses an EOC network data transmission system, comprising a master device and a slave device, between which a splitter or a distributor is arranged. The direction, in which the master device transfers data packets to the slave device through the splitter or the distributor or both is the down direction of the data transmission; and the direction, in which the slave device transfers data packets to the master device through the splitter, or the distributor or both is the up direction of the data transmission. A down identifier is contained in the lead code of an Ethernet frame in the down direction in which the master device sends data, and an up identifier is contained in the lead code of an Ethernet frame in the up direction in which the slave device sends data. When receiving the Ethernet frames, the slave device judges the Ethernet frame in the up direction and the Ethernet frame in the down direction according to the identifiers contained in the lead codes of the Ethernet frames. By adding the up identifier and the down identifier to the lead codes for data transmission in an EOC network, the EOC network data transmission system enables the up data sent from the slave device and the down data sent from the master device to be distinguished.

The invention discloses a method for ATM cell bonding and recombination by using cell descriptors. The method comprises the following steps: firstly, while receiving each ATM cell, a control module generates the cell descriptor of the cell; then, the control module queues the cell descriptors according to the transmission order; finally, the control module recombines the corresponding ATM cells into the AAL frame according to the transmission order of the cell descriptors. Through the ordering of cell descriptors in an internal memory, compared with the ordering of ATM cells in the external memory in the prior art, the access of the external memory can be reduced. Therefore, the occupancy of the bandwidth of the memory is reduced; simultaneously, because the identical ATM cell is always stored in an identical area in the ordering and the recombination, the occupancy of the space of the external memory is reduced; and the working efficiency of hardware processing equipment is finally improved.
