The invention discloses a process for recovering nickel by adding sodium sulfide in an aqueous solution containing nickel and ammonium. The process comprises the following steps: dissolving sodium sulfide in water in a mass ratio (liquid-solid ratio) of water to sodium sulfide of 3:1 so as to prepare a sodium sulfide solution; slowly adding the prepared sodium sulfide solution in an aqueous solution containing 4-5g/L of NH<4+> and 0.1-0.2g/L of Ni, wherein the mass ratio of sodium sulfide solution to aqueous solution containing nickel and ammonium is 1:(2-100); and heating to 70-80 DEG C, stirring for 0.5-1 hour, filtering and recovering nickel. The process can be used for recovering nickel from the aqueous solution containing less nickel and ammonium, has the advantages of changeable production scale, wide resource utilization, simple process route, less investment, low energy consumption, no environment pollution, high nickel recovery rate, low production cost and is convenient for operation, and an extremely effective and economical and applicable way is provided for treating the aqueous solution containing ammonium and less nickel.

The invention discloses a method for removing chromium and recycling nickel by oxidizing a nickel/chromium-containing water solution, which comprises the following steps: dissolving oxidant in water to obtain a solution (the liquid-to-solid ratio by mass is 3:1); slowly adding a prepared sodium sulfide solution into a solution containing 20-30 g/L Ni, 3-4 g/L Cr and 20-30 g/L H2SO4, wherein the mass ratio of oxidant solution to nickel/chromium-containing water solution is (1-1.2):10; heating to 70-80 DEG C, stirring for 2-3 hours, and neutralizing by adding sodium carbonate until the pH value reaches 8.2-8.5, thereby precipitating nickel; and filtering, and washing filter residues to recycle nickel. The filtrate and washing water are discharged after precipitating chromium by reduction. The technique can be used for recycling nickel from a nickel/chromium-containing water solution, can be used for both large and small scale production, has the advantages of wide resource utilization, simple process route, low investment, low energy consumption, high recovery rate of nickel and low production cost, is simple to operate, and provides an extremely effective, economical and applicable way for recycling nickel from a nickel/chromium-containing water solution.
