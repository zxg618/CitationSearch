The method is that: the correlation additive value is determined by utilizing a tree-shaped adding structure; the exhaustive comparison is carried out on the correlation results by utilizing a tree-shaped comparing structure; then, a soft-decision output of each bit is determined. Therefore, the number of adders and comparators are greatly reduced. When calculating the correlation of an entire code word, the correlation is divided into the correlation of an info-bit part and the correlation of a check-bit part. Similar to the correlation of the info-bit part, the correlation of the check-bit part also uses the tree-shaped adding structure; only a simple reordering operation is added. When calculating the 256 correlation values of the entire code word, the negative symmetry property of a NR code table is utilized, thus leading the calculating amount of the addition to be reduced by one time. On the basis of a correlative MAP decoding algorithm, the realizing method can greatly reduce the addition and operation. The realizing method can be used for a digital television receiving chip according with the terrestrial broadcasting and transmitting of Chinese digital televisions, or other receiving chips of wireless transmitting systems which use NR codes.
