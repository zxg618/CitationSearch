The vacuum boundary valve includes the valve body, the valve spool and the driving device installed on the valve body, it is characterized by: the flow passage part of said valve body from the entrance to the exit is a straight path, said straight path is crossed and connected with the valve spool active part obliquely, the straight path is equipped with a near symmetrical sealing sphere which is matched with said valve spool and plays a role of vacuum boundary sealing. The near symmetrical sphere sealing used in the invention has better sealing effect. The flow passage part of valve body from the entrance to the exit is a straight path, thereby the path drag force is smaller than prior technology. The invention uses locking device to lock the drive piston driven, at the same time it uses the controller to control the start time of valve and make the valve has enough opening time to discharge all discharges, and it allows specific amount of air enter the system.

Mutant cholera holotoxins having single or double amino acid substitutions or insertions have reduced toxicity compared to the wild-type cholera holotoxin. The mutant cholera holotoxins are useful as adjuvants in antigenic compositions to enhance the immune response in a vertebrate host to a selected antigen from a pathogenic bacterium, virus, fungus, or parasite, a cancer cell, a tumor cell, an allergen, or a self-molecule.

A mutant cholera holotoxin featuring a point mutation at amino acid of the A subunit, wherein the glutamic acid residue is replaced by an amino acid other than aspartic acid, is useful as an adjuvant in an antigenic composition to enhance the immune response in a vertebrate host to a selected antigen from a pathogenic bacterium, virus, fungus or parasite. In a particular embodiment, the amino acid 29 is histidine. The mutant cholera holotoxin may contain at least one additional mutation in the A subunit at a position other than amino acid 29. The antigenic composition may include a second adjuvant in addition to the mutant cholera holotoxin.
