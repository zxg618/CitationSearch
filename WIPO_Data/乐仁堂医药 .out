The embodiment of the invention discloses a quality control method of vein-dredging and heart-nourishing pills. The method determines the contents of five index components, wherein the five index components comprise liquiritin, polygonum multiflorum glycoside, ononin, schizandrin and glycyrrhizic acid. The method comprises the following steps: (1) establishing standard curves of the five index components; (2) acquiring high performance liquid chromatogram of a test article solution; and (3) determining the contents of the five index components in a test article. According to the method disclosed by the invention, the contents of the five index components in the vein-dredging and heart-nourishing pills are determined simultaneously by virtue of high performance liquid chromatography, and the method has the characteristics of being simple and quick, strong in specificity, high in precision and good in repeatability. By testing the contents of the five index components of the vein-dredging and heart-nourishing pills, the quality of the vein-dredging and heart-nourishing pills can be effectively controlled, so that the clinical curative effect of the vein-dredging and heart-nourishing pills can be guaranteed.
