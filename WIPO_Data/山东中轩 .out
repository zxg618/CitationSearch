A maintenance tool used for double insulator strings of a direct current transmission line comprises fixtures installed at the two sides of the double insulator strings and a tensioning device connected between the fixtures. The fixture comprises a clamp (1) on a V type string connected fixedly to a fitting hanging point angle steel at a tower body side, a clamp (2) on a cross arm connected fixedly on a cross arm wrapper sheet (8), and a knife-like clamp (3) connected fixedly to a V-type in-line plate (6). The tensioning device is a mechanical transmission lead screw (4) which is connected between the clamp (1) on the V type string and the knife-like clamp (3) or between the clamp (2) on the cross arm and the knife-like clamp (3). The maintenance tool has the advantages of sensible structure, high integral strength, low weight and reliable operation, thereby providing a reliable guarantee for the safe commissioning as well as routine maintenance of the direct current transmission line.

一种晾水塔，它包括塔身，塔身上部飞出气孔，安装在出气孔内的晾水风机，在出气孔上部连接有排气筒，所述排气筒的直径不小于出气孔的直径。本实用新型的有益效果为：它可以极大地利用出气孔热气在上升过程中气压降低，从而吸进外界空气进行二次降温；设置排气筒后，虽然一次性投资虽然较大，但是优点多：一是提高晾水效果，二是降低晾水塔风机效率，减少用电量，三是减少利用高空稀释，减少二次污染，在一定程度上合理达到异味治理的目的。
