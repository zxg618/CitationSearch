The invention relates to a dual-protein lactic acid bacteria milk beverage. The dual-protein lactic acid bacteria milk beverage comprises the following components of raw material according to the parts by weight, and is calculated according to the usage amount of the milk beverage per ton: 200 kg of 400 kg of antibiotic-free standard fresh milk, 40 kg of 60kg of soybean protein isolate, 100 kg of 120 kg of white granulated sugar, 4 kg of 6 kg of stabilizer for milk products, 15 kg of 25 kg of direct vat set microbial strain, 20 kg of 40 kg of concentrated juice, 1 kg of 2 kg of citric acid monohydrate, 0.4 kg of 0.6 kg of sodium citrate, 0.2 kg of 0.4 kg of yoghurt flavor and the residual of water. The dual-protein lactic acid bacteria milk beverage has the obvious health care effect and has milk protein and soybean protein isolate, particularly, the enhanced soybean protein isolate in the milk is fermented by adopting the lactic acid bacteria, and the protein is transformed into small molecule polypeptide and amino acid, and can meet the demands of persons older than 2 years old on various essential amino acids.

The invention relates to an amphiregulin lactobacillus milk beverage, which is composed of the following ingredients according to the weight that: 200 Kg to 400 Kg of inertance standardized fresh milk, 40 Kg to 60 Kg of soybean protein isolated, 100 Kg to 200 Kg of white granulated sugar, 4 Kg to 6 Kg of dairy stabilizer, 15 Kg to 25 Kg of direct vat set bacterium, 20 Kg to 40 Kg of fruit juice concentrate, 1 Kg to 2 Kg of citric acid mono, 0.4 Kg to 0.6 Kg of sodium citrate, 0.2 Kg to 0.4 Kg of yoghurt flavor and water. The invention has remarkable health care function, which, with milk protein and the soybean protein isolated, in particular that adopting lactobacillus for fermenting when aggrandizing the soybean protein isolated in the milk, translates the proteide into micro molecule polypeptide and amino acid, thus meeting the demand of various essential amino acids for people aged over 2.

The invention relates to a kind of the lecithin milky beverage. It contains (Wt.% per ton): fresh milk 200-400kg, sugar 40-60kg, asparteme 0.8-1.2kg, dairy stabilizer 4-6kg, citric acid monohydration 2-4kg, llactic acid 1-2Kg,sodium citrate 0.1-0.5Kg,lecithin 0.5-1.5Kg,milk flavor 0.1-0.4Kg,Citrus garadis flavor 0.2-0.4Kg,grapefruit flavor 0.1-0.3Kg,Garcinia mangostana L. flavor 0.1-0.3Kg,remaining water. Such product has the merit both of the nutrition from the milk and the lecithin function. It mainly works on dissolving the cholesterin,antiatherogenic;activation of the cells;activation of the brain enginery,prevention of the senile dementia;being young and long live, protecting your liver function. Alcohol and high cholesterin are two mainly factors to hepar adiposum and hepatocirrhosis, on the contrary, the lecithin can restore the damaged liver cells.
