The invention relates to a method for calculating service time of software in a system. The method comprises the following steps: storing an initial software service time value and an accumulated software service time value into a flash memory of the system; detecting whether the software is installed or started; recording a time value before the time of the system is modified and a time value after the time of the system is modified, changing the initial time value in the flash memory into the time value before the time of the system is modified, and changing the accumulated time value into the software service time value before the time of the system is changed; updating the accumulated software service time value through a time period; detecting whether the total accumulated software time exceeds a time limit; and adopting a limiting measure for the use of the software in the system. In the method for calculating the service time of the software in the system, the timing is more accurate, and the cost is lower.

The invention relates to a mobile phone communication method and a system adopting the same. The mobile phone communication method comprises that: first and second client identification modules of a mobile phone client log on a server and acquire first and second user identification codes generated by the server respectively; the mobile phone client binds a number corresponding to the first client identification module to the first user identification code, binds the number corresponding to the second client identification module to the second user identification code and transmits the binding association data of the first and second client identification modules to the server; the server stores the binding association data of the first and second client identification modules respectively; and according to the binding association data, the first and second client identification modules of the mobile phone client independently communicate with the server respectively. When communicating with the server, the first and second client identification modules of the mobile phone client are mutually independent and do not interfere with each other.

The invention relates to a mutual authentication method between a terminal and a server. The method comprises that: the terminal generates an identity number and a first random number and sends the identity number and the first random number to the server; the server verifies whether the identity number exists in a database of the server; the server generates a first operation result according to the identity number, the first random number and a server secret key, and the first operation result and a second random number are transmitted to the terminal; the terminal generates a second operation result according to the identity number, the first random number and the server secret key and carries out authentication on the server according to the first and second operation results; the terminal generates a third operation result according to the second random number and a terminal secret key and sends the third operation result to the server; and the server generates a fourth operation result according to the second random number and the terminal secret key and carries out authentication on the terminal according to the third and fourth operation results.

The invention discloses a method for transmitting audio and video under an environment of a network with different speeds applied in a multimedia communication system which at least comprises a data transmitting terminal and a data receiving terminal. The data transmitting terminal at least comprises an encoder, a data buffering and a first control logic, and the data receiving terminal controls the encoder through the first control logic according to the buffer filling degree of the data buffering and selects the source code rate of a content source. The method can be used for automatically detecting the actual data transmitting speed so that the encoding code rate of the audio and video is suitable for the changing network environment and the actual data transmitting speed, therefore, a user enjoys the optimal multimedia quality under the changing network environment.

The invention provides a method for executing image interpolation by using a memory structure with classified speed, and aims to improve the efficiency of an interpolation algorithm in the image and video interpolation algorithm. The memory structure with classified speed comprises an original memory, a temporary memory and a target memory; a processing chip is used for achieving the image interpolation; the temporary memory is formed in the memory with higher speed; a portion of image data in the original memory is stored in the high-speed temporary memory; the image data in a high-speed space are subjected to row interpolation and column interpolation, and are integrally written and stored in the large-capacity target memory after interpolation; the rest of the original data is extracted from the original memory after the storage is completed to update the data in the temporary memory and execute interpolation; and the above steps are repeated until interpolation of all images are achieved. The method achieves the purposes of improving image interpolation efficiency, reducing memory cost and reducing system power consumption.
