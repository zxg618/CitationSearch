The invention provides an on-chip clock uncertainty measurement circuit device. The device comprises a delay circuit and a detection unit, wherein the delay circuit comprises a rough adjustment circuit and a fine adjustment circuit; two paths of clock signals A and B to be measured from two different measurement points of the same time source on a chip are roughly adjusted and delayed by the rough adjustment circuit; the roughly adjusted clock signals A and B are finely adjusted and delayed by the fine adjustment circuit; the phases of the finely adjusted clock signals A and B are detected by the detection unit; and the clock skew of the clock signals A and B is calculated when the phases of the finely adjusted clock signals A and B are the same. The invention also provides a measurement system which comprises the measurement circuit device and a ruler circuit. In the invention, on-chip measurement is performed on the clock skew and even clock jitter by using a composite non-linear delay line, so the measurement accuracy is high and the required data quantity is small.

The invention discloses a device and a method for protecting a source code. The device comprises a keyword information storage unit, an irreplaceable identifier information storage unit, an identifier replacing information storage unit, an identifier selecting unit, and an identifier replacing unit. The method comprises the following steps: prestoring keyword information, irreplaceable identifier information, and identifier information before and after an identifier is replaced, and executing the following steps: selecting the corresponding identifier in the source code according to a preset rule; comparing the selected identifier with the keyword information and the irreplaceable identifier information; and replacing the identifier different from the keyword information and the irreplaceable identifier information according to the identifier information before and after the identifier is replaced. In the invention, the identifier obtained after replacing the specific identifier in the source code contains no meaning or information. Therefore, the source code of which the identifier is replaced is protected well.
