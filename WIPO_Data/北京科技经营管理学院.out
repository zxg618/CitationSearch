The invention method is to add deacidify agent in electrolyte of lithium ion cell that spinel lithium manganeseate is used as positive pole material to deacidite, then to add dehydrator to remove the moisture produced by deacidity. The deacidify agent is oxide of zinc, aluminium, magnesium, calcium and their one or multiple compound or mixture. The additive quantity of deacidity agent is 0.5-20 percent of electrolyte weight. In electrolyte, said dehydrator is calcium sulfate, 3A/4A molecular sieve and active carbon agent, the additive quantity is more than mole value of deacidify agent, then to add metal lithium plate to do further dehydration. By deacidify to electrolyte in the invention, content of free acid HF in electrolyte is reduced less than 20 ppm, soluting action of HF to LiMn2O4 is reduced, capacity and cycling performance of LiMn2O4 is increased.
