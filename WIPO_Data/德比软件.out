The invention discloses a distributed mass dynamic task engine and a method for processing data with the distributed mass dynamic task engine. The distributed mass DTE comprises a DTE Gateway server and a DTE Agent server, wherein the DTE Gateway server is used for managing the DTE Agent server, and the DTE Agent server is used for executing tasks. When only a certain kind of tasks need to be executed, a task client side uses the distributed mass DTE; when a certain group of tasks need to be executed and managed, a task manager uses the distributed mass DTE. According to the distributed mass dynamic task engine and the method for processing data with the distributed mass dynamic task engine, not only can a plurality of tasks be executed in parallel, but also when content of the tasks changes, the mask executing server does not need to be updated, and the tasks can be executed just by adjusting task scripts.

The invention relates to a procedure for the presentation of text in a CGA-graphic mode on a screen of a personal computer. For text-output a bit-sequence is produced for each pixel containing a two-bit sequence, especially 00, determining the background-color. The stored bit pattern of the text signs is connected with this bit-sequence. If the bit 0 exists in the stored bit pattern for the respective pixel, no change is made. If the bit 1 exists in the stored bit for the respective pixel, a bit sequence containing two bit is produced, which determines the desired front color and is stored in the video-memory.

The invention relates to a procedure for scrolling some raster scan lines in a window of a screen operated in the graphic-mode of a personal computer. One first line of the raster scan lines to be scrolled, is moved into a raster scan line within the window and is marked with a source-pointer. The raster scan line within a window, in which this line is to be moved into, is marked with a destination pointer. Afterwards, a scroll is performed and repeated until all lines to be scrolled are in raster scan lines of the window. At the same time with the first line, the subsequent third line is also at least scrolled in raster scan lines of the screen window. Afterwards, the second line and the fourth line of some raster scan lines to be scrolled are scrolled from lines in raster scan lines of the screen window and so on until all lines to be scrolled are scrolled in raster scan lines of the window.
