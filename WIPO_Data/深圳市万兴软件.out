The invention relates to a method for converting video files into SWF files, comprising the following steps: extracting related parameter values of a source video file, and calculating related parameter values of a main SWF file required to be generated on the basis of the extracted related parameter values; converting the source video file into at least one FLV file; generating at least one sub SWF file according to the calculated related parameter values of the main SWF file, and respectively embedding the FLV file into each sub SWF file; generating one main SWF file according to the calculated related parameter values of the main SWF file, and adding the at least one sub SWF file into the main SWF file frame by frame; adding play rules into the main SWF file; and storing and outputtingthe main SWF file. The invention also discloses a system using the method. By utilizing the method and the system of the invention, not only the standard format of Flash files are not destroyed, but also only one SWF file is generated no matter how long the video file is, thereby breaking through the limitation of the SWF file on the length of the video file.
