A wireless communication terminal system capable of high-efficiently rapidly using data transmission between user and server, comprises: a user behavior collection device for collecting statistic data of user behavior based on user using the special operation; a storing device for storing operation and special service content and for storing the collected statistic data of user behavior; a packing device for packing the data for waiting transmitting containing the statistic data of user behavior into a data packet with predetermined wireless communication transmission agreement; and a wireless dispatching device for transmitting the data packet to the server only once time by wireless network and receiving the data packet transmitted from the server. The present invention overcomes low efficiency shortcoming of prior art needing multi-time communication between the server and the terminal. At the same time, the present invention can dynamic regulate supplied content according to user using operation and service, and can supply differences content service.
