The invention relates to a nonane diacid purification method, including the following procedures: 1, rectify nonane diacid admixture under decompressed condition, vacuum to 500Pa and keep a rectifying still not to exceed 180 DEG C, distill the pelargonic acid and the components with boiling points lower than that of pelargonic acid, then add water steam to the rest mixture, making sure that the total weight percentage of the monoprotic acids with boiling points lower than that of pelargonic acid in the rest material is not more than 3%; 2, rectify the rest material under decompressed condition, vacuum to approximately 300Pa and keep the rectifying still not to exceed 240 DEG C, then then add water steam and distill crude nonane diacid; 3, mix the crude nonane diacid with solvent based on mass ratio of 1:2-8, then heat the mixture to 70-90 DEG C and stir for 30 minutes, then cool the mixture to 25 DEG C and again stir for 30 minutes, and finally crystallize the mixture and centrifugate to get the crystallized product; 4, dry the crystallized product with an oven in decompressed condition to get the final product, nonane diacid. The method has the advantages that the product has a purity of above 99% and the content of monoprotic acid is less than 0.05%; the method simplifies the process and reduces production cost.

Mutant cholera holotoxins having single or double amino acid substitutions or insertions have reduced toxicity compared to the wild-type cholera holotoxin. The mutant cholera holotoxins are useful as adjuvants in antigenic compositions to enhance the immune response in a vertebrate host to a selected antigen from a pathogenic bacterium, virus, fungus, or parasite, a cancer cell, a tumor cell, an allergen, or a self-molecule.

A building structural element (1) having a pair of beams (5) joined by a plate member (13) or alternatively a generally U-shaped channel having a pair of opposed side walls (33, 34) joined by a further portion (35). In either case an interior space (57) is defined by either the pair of beams (5) and plate member (13) or by the pair of side walls (33, 34) and the further portion (35). A cementitious material, such as concrete, occupies a substantial volume of the interior space (57) and the building structural element (1) has a post-tensioned pre-stressing force applied thereto.

A method and an apparatus for scanning a vehicle wheel, wherein a location on the wheel is sensed by means of a light team emitted by a light source and is reflected to a position-sensitive receiver. The spacing of the sensed location relative to a reference location is measured from the directions of the emitted beam and the reflected beam. The light source and the position-sensitive receiver are synchronously pivoted about a common axis by means of a rotary drive including a stepping motor for successive measurement steps.

A mutant cholera holotoxin featuring a point mutation at amino acid of the A subunit, wherein the glutamic acid residue is replaced by an amino acid other than aspartic acid, is useful as an adjuvant in an antigenic composition to enhance the immune response in a vertebrate host to a selected antigen from a pathogenic bacterium, virus, fungus or parasite. In a particular embodiment, the amino acid 29 is histidine. The mutant cholera holotoxin may contain at least one additional mutation in the A subunit at a position other than amino acid 29. The antigenic composition may include a second adjuvant in addition to the mutant cholera holotoxin.

A rotary angle sensor for a rotary member such as a motor vehicle wheel comprises an emitter, and a plurality of reflectors arranged in the form of flat surfaces on a circular-cylindrical surface of the rotary member or of a rotational portion which in operation rotates with the rotary member, light emitted by the emitter being reflected by the reflectors and received by a detector. The detector produces corresponding signals which are evaluated in an evaluation arrangement for detection of the rotational angle involved.
