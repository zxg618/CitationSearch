Disclosed are an intelligent power utilization system and method for parks. The intelligent power utilization system comprises an acquisition system (U1), a data processing system (U2), an application system (U3) and a service system (U4). The acquisition system (U1), the data processing system (U2) and the application system (U3) are all connected to an external system (U5) through the service system (U4). The application system (U3) comprises an intelligent interaction application subsystem (U31), a power utilization monitoring application subsystem (U32), an energy efficiency analysis application subsystem (U33), an ordered power utilization application subsystem (U34), a system safety application subsystem (U35) and a man-machine interaction interface (U36). The system and method can lead enterprise users to carry out requirement response actively, effectively achieve energy conservation and emissions reduction, and peak clipping and valley filling of intelligent parks, improve the intelligent power utilization level of the parks, and then improve the load balancing capacity of the parks to ensure the safe and stable operation of the grid.

Disclosed are a method and system for analyzing user loads in combination with time information. When an enterprise is in a non-full-time work mode, the work period of the enterprise is adjusted to obtain the electricity price in the work period, and the electricity fee of the enterprise is obtained by multiplying the electricity price and electric power consumption. When the enterprise is in a full-time work mode, the electric power consumption per hour of the enterprise is adjusted, and the electricity fee per hour of the enterprise is obtained by multiplying the electric power consumption and the electricity price per hour, and the total electricity fee of the enterprise is obtained by accumulating the electricity fee per hour. The method and system enable the enterprise to obtain the total electricity fee after continuously adjusting the work time or the electric power consumption per hour, so that the enterprise can reasonably arrange work periods at different work times or different workloads under the condition of knowing the electricity fee required to be paid, and reduce the electricity cost.
