When arranging objects in paragraph, the layout program obtains horizontal justifying attribute of object and adjusts horizontal coordinate of object according to the horizontal justifying attribute. Obtaining vertical justifying attribute of object, the layout program determines whether the object possesses parameters of positioning attribute setup in advance; if yes, the layout program adjusts vertical coordinate of object according to parameters of justifying attribute; otherwise, the layout program adjusts vertical coordinate of object according to parameters of vertical position in vertical justifying attribute. In editing procedure, based on parameters of justifying attribute setup by user, the invention adjusts objects to the positions expected by the user automatically such as 'final page' or 'specified page'. The invention provides convenient and flexible tools for users to edit files.

A method of use electronic table unit as a data object storage bank and for interlinking adopts each unit to store data object and to use electronic table as data object storage bank with two dimensional table forming unit by the cross between each column to another and the formed electronic table unit being used as a data object storage tank to store the data. A storage unit will be formed by the number of line and column in the electronic table and the data object will be divided into three kinds of base, composite and combination. The data interlinking can be established quickly between office applications by "stick interlinking" command in making a real interlinking of data source in the target object to target object for keeping the synchronizatino and uniformity of the data.
