A configurable cost distribution calculation method based on an open source technology includes the steps: synchronizing all fields in a data table of a designated database to form corresponding metadata including at least one calculating parameter field and at least one calculating result field; forming factor data according to the calculating parameter fields and the calculating result fields of the metadata; receiving configuration operations of a user, and operating calculating factors and result factors according to a calculating rule; receiving data assembly operations of an administrator, and assembling the calculating rule and the data table through an SQL (structured query language) to form a calculating model. The factor data include the calculating factors corresponding to the calculating parameter fields and the result factors corresponding to the calculating result fields. Data in the database are mapped into the factor data, so that the user does not need to contact with the bottom database and the obscure fields and can freely configure the calculating rule of the factor data, and calculating flexibility is improved.

The invention relates to the technical field of aviation. The inventive air data measuring system comprises a pitot pressure probe provided with sensing ports, an anti-freezing electric heater, a conduit, a pressure transducer, an outdoor air temperature sensor and an onboard computer; all the devices and parts are fixed in a streamlined housing attached to an aircraft and composed of an axial symmetric plane; the measuring system acquiring air data can be controlled automatically and interacts with the aircraft and other subsystems by electric connectors through an information interchange channel and power cords. In order to provide the system with more automation, the housing also comprises a power supply adapter. In order to extend the measuring range, reduce the structure weight and the required number of pressure measuring channels, the system comprises a pitot pressure probe which extends out convexly from the housing, is in a shape of small needle and is provided with sensing ports between the edges. In order to reduce the power required by the anti-freezing system and to simplify the structure design, the housing surface or a part thereof can be made of a hydrophobic material. In order to extend flight parameter measuring range, when the attack angle and the sideslip angle is -180 to 180 degrees, the whole range is covered.
