The invention relates to preparation for a medicinal intermediate 6-chloro-5-fluroindole for synthesizing an anti-cancer medicament, which comprises the following steps that: firstly, 3-fluro-4-aminotoluene reacts in a concentrated sulfuric acid system, the pH value is adjusted to be neutral after the reaction, and the mixture is filtered to obtain 3-fluro-4-amino-6-nitrotoluene; secondly, a sodium nitrite solution and cuprous chloride are added in the concentrated sulfuric acid system, and the mixture is diluted by clear water to obtain 3-fluro-4-chloro-6-nitrotoluene; thirdly, the 3-fluro-4-chloro-6-nitrotoluene and N, N-dimethyl formamide dimethylacetal react in a molecular sieve drying DMF system to obtain 2-(methylamino) ethylene-4-fluro-5-chloronitrobenzene; and finally, iron powder is added into an acetic acid system, and after the reaction, the mixture is recrystallized by using a mixed system containing petroleum ether to obtain the white 6-chloro-5-fluroindole. The method has the advantages of simple operation, environmental friendliness, high purity and low cost, and is suitable for industrialized production.
