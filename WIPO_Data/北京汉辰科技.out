This method connects the video decoding extension board (VDE) with the digital TV (DT) and the IPTV system chip (IS). VDE offers the different video decoding mode other than DT and IS. There are a net card (NC) and an audio/ video output unit on the main board. NC transfers directly the transfer stream (TS) receiving from the net to the audio decoder (AD) of DT and IS. The essential video data stream (ES) drawn from TS is transferred to VDE. AD determines the system clock (SC) and determines the audio decoding time/ the output time according to SC. Besides, VDE also determines the video decoding time and the output time according to SC.
