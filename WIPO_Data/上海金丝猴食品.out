The invention relates to deformation resisting cream candy and a method for producing the same. The deformation resisting cream candy comprises colloid in addition to the components of the colloid cream candy, wherein the colloid is complex colloid whose weight is 1.0-2.0 percent of the total weight of the cream candy. The method for producing deformation resisting cream candy is based on the method for producing the colloid cream candy and comprises the following steps: preprocessing the complex colloid in the sugar boiling stage, cooling massecuite to 80-90 DEG C in the complex colloid stirring and mixing stage, putting the preprocessed complex colloid, grease and milk powder in a stirring pot in sequence according to proportion, stirring the mixture in the stirring pot evenly, cooling and shaping the mixture. The deformation resisting cream candy is produced by dissolving, swelling and mixing evenly the complex colloid. Compared with the common cream candy, the deformation resisting cream candy has the advantages that the thermal melting peak temperature is increased by about 4.5 DEG C, the thermal stability is obviously improved and deformation resisting ability is improved. The problem that the common cream candy deforms is well solved.

The invention relates to a method for producing selenium-enriched functional jelly candy by compounding organic selenium and vitamins. The method comprises adding organic selenium and vitamin E, vitamin C and vitamin A into compounded jelly with carrageenan or gelatin as main body, and conducting the prior jelly candy production processes which comprise boiling, adding swollen starch, heating under stirring, adjusting color and flavor, shaping, drying, and packaging. The inventive functional jelly candy retains the unique flavor and texture of jelly candy and is palatable. The functional jelly candy contains selenium in form of organic selenium so as to achieve selenium supplementing effect, and has synergetic anti-oxidation effect of vitamin E and selenium. The functional jelly candy is safe and effective.
