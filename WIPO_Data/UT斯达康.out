A method for rapid and smooth channel switching, which is used in digital TV system for channel switching is provided. In the case of channel switching, at first, the decoder is adjusted into a fast forward state, and decodes the video for display, then the decoder is recovered into a normal playing state and begins to decode the audio and video simultaneously. In order to ensure the non-loss of the audio and video, the system clock is adjusted to guarantee the non-loss of the audio, at the same time, the video clock acceptance-limit parameter N of the decoder is adjusted to guarantee the non-loss of the video. The value N is reduced gradually to approach the value N in the state of synchronization of video and audio. Then the synchronization of the audio and video is realized and the next channel is began to display. With the method of present invention, the channel switching time can be shortened within one second in the same network condition without changing the configuration of the encoder. The speed of channel switching of present invention can reach or exceed that in traditional cable TV. And it is solely necessary to adjust the system software and needn't to adjust the hardware, thus, the improvement of the switching speed can be realized with the minimum cost.

Unicast delivery of media to multiple recipients is achieved. An originating client issues call setup request. A list of addresses of multiple recipient clients is obtained from the call setup request. A connection is then made with the plurality of recipient clients and the media is delivered from the originating client to the plurality of recipient clients. A universal user port agent receives the list of addresses from the originating client and makes the connection with the plurality of recipient clients. When an originating client receives a reply message that a recipient client is unavailable, it may be built with the capability to search for alternate addresses and send a new call setup request.

An initial call is setup by a universal port user agent by sending an invitation to the proxy server. The proxy server performs a directory lookup from a back end server to obtain route information to a destination. The route information is passed to the universal port user agent in response and is stored in the universal port user agent. When subsequent calls to the same destination are requested, the subsequent calls can be setup using the stored route information. A universal port user agent performs these call setups. The route information memory is managed based on a number of routes stored and the age of the stored routes. In certain embodiments the calls are setup using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

The invention provides a method for quickly and smoothly switching channels, which is used in a digital television system for switching the channels, wherein, during the process of switching the channels, a decoder is firstly adjusted to forward state and video play is decoded, and then the decoder returns to normal state and begins to simultaneously decode audios and videos. In order to guarantee that the audios and the videos are not lost, a system clock is adjusted and the audios are guaranteed to be not lost; simultaneously, a tolerance limit parameter N of a video clock of the decoder is adjusted and the videos are guaranteed to be not lost. Moreover, N value is reduced gradually and approaches N value when the audios and the videos are synchronized; synchronization of the audios and the videos is realized and a next channel is begun to play. By adoption of the method of the invention, time for switching the channels is shortened to be within one second under the condition that arrangement of a coder is unnecessary to change in the same network condition, and switching speed reaches or exceeds speed for switching channels of the prior cable television; moreover, improvement of the switching speed is realized through minimum cost only with the necessity for adjusting system softwares and without the necessity for adjusting hardwares.

The present invention relates to a structure of a Management Information Base (MIB) communicated between a Network Management System (NMS) and an agent of a Network Element (NE). Conventionally, an operator provides the MIB to the NMS and the NE agent before the communication. If the MIB is not provided before the communication, the NMS cannot know what data to be retrieved from the NE agent and thus cannot understand the MIB. In order to resolve this problem, the present invention suggests using the claimed structure of MIB for communicating between the NMS and the NE agent. According to the present invention, when a MIB of the NE agent is changed, the MIB of the NE agent is reflected to the NMS automatically, and not by an operator's action. Therefore, the network can be managed automatically.

The present invention is directed to a method for correcting time data in a network management application. In a conventional Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) application, time errors occur due to a time tick or a time delay in the network. To resolve the above problem, the present invention suggests a method for correcting the time data, wherein the network management application waits for the most polling periods to save system resources, checks time data for the last polling period, and requests performance information and statistic information. With the present invention, the possibility of incurring time errors due to the information request for polling can be resolved.

The invention is related to transmitting/receiving method in quasi-orthogonal time space group code, receiver and transmitter and corresponding comm. system. Random rotation matrix is obtained through Graham-Schmitt orthogonalized decomposing plural gauss random square matrix. After using multiplication between random rotation matrix and symbolic vector of planisphere, the transmitting terminal carries out encoding quasi-orthogonal time space group code so as to make new planisphere possess characteristic of random distribution. Thus, interferences among multiple antenna symbols at transmitting end are distributed evenly. Moreover, distribution of probability density in high power interference segment is smaller relatively so as to raise performance of system in high SNR. Accordingly, all possible symbolic vectors of planisphere at receiving end are carried out rotation same as transmitting end randomly and then maximum likelihood decoding is carried out.
