The method is characterized in that the numerical control machining code is reversely read and analyzed into internal uniform data according to a numerical control type given by a user, and then a post-processing system is utilized to regenerate different numerical control types of numerical control machining codes to achieve the aim of code conversion. The internal uniform data can be graphically and three-dimensionally displayed, and can be rotated, zoomed and translated for viewing. The internal uniform data records a line number that the machining code is positioned, thereby conveniently performing the mutual lookup from a graphic to a text or vice versa, and immediately positioning to a problematic code segment. The traversing to the internal uniform data can research coordinate points within a given range, and an abnormal orbit segment can be quickly found by combining the three-dimensional graphic display and the mutual positioning, thereby effectively solving the problem that the machining code is difficult to check, reducing the preparation time for an early machining stage, and increasing the qualification rate of products.
