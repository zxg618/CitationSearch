The present invention provides a preparation method of polyimide, comprising the following steps: a) carrying out a dehydration polymerization reaction on a diamine and an anhydride of an organic acid in a non-polar solvent to obtain a mixture, the non-polar solvent being one or more of arene, aliphatic hydrocarbon, halogenated arene and halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, and the anhydride of the organic acid being one or more of dianhydride and single anhydride; and b) filtering the mixture obtained in step a) and drying to obtain the polyimide. In the present invention, the dehydration polymerization reaction between the diamine and the anhydride of the organic acid can be carried out directly in the non-polar solvent to obtain the polyimide which cannot be dissolved in the non-polar solvent. Therefore, polyimide powder with fine particles can be obtained by directly filtering and drying the reaction mixture without washing. Not only complex washing and grinding processes are not needed, but also the production period is shortened, the production cost is reduced, and the large-scale production becomes more convenient.

The invention provides isomeric polythioether imide and a preparation method thereof. The mixed isomers of chlorophthalic anhydride, which are adopted as raw materials, react with monosubstituted amine to generate N-substituted-3-chlorophthalimide and the isomer of N-substituted-4-chlorophthalimide. The isomer of the N-substituted-4-chlorophthalimide reacts with an alkali metal sulphide in a nonpolar aprotic solvent and the isomers of N, N'-disubstituted-thioether-4-imide with different proportions is generated. The thioether-4-imide is hydrolyzed and acidized to obtain the isomers of thioether-typed tetracid, with different proportions, and then the isomers of the thioether-typed tetracid, with different proportions, are dehydrated to obtain the isomers of thioether-typed tetracid dianhydride, with different proportions. The dianhydride isomers can react with organic diamine in a polymerization manner to generate the corresponding isomeric polythioether imide resins. The resins have excellent combination properties of good heat resistance, mechanical properties, melt processability and the like, thereby being widely applied to relevant fields of high temperature resistant engineering plastics, films, sizing agents, enamelled wires, plastic foams, fibers, advanced composite materials and the like.

The invention belongs to the domain of the polymers technology and is the polyimide half interpenetrating networks pitch and the producing process. With the method of the dry mixing, the wet mixing or the melt mixing, the tri-benzene bis ether polyimide with thermal plasticity is combined with the thermoset bi-smaleimide, then the half interpenetrating networks is formed by the hot pressing. The dosage of the tri-benzene bis ether polyimide is 5-90 percentage and 10-70 percentage optimally. The mixed pitch can be shared with other filler material such as the fraphite, the supramoly, the silicon dioxide, the titanium dioxide, the polyetrafluoroethylene, the carbon fiber and the fibergals in order to improve the ability of the engineering plastic and to satisfy the consumer. Using the high tenacity of the tri-benzene bis ether polyimide with thermal plasticity to reinforce the rigid cross linked structure of the bismaleimide, we can gain the half interpenetrating of the high tenacity and the intension; the material requirement of the different capability needed by a vatiety of purpose can be satisfied by the different mixing methods.
