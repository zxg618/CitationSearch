The invention relates to a method for generating interactive information in 3D scene rendering. During the 3D scene rendering, the method comprises the steps of: setting textures of all models in a 3D scene as a static interactive data texture diagram, and setting information merging mode parameters; and performing rendering operation on the 3D scene preset with the static interactive data texture diagram and the information merging mode parameters, and merging dynamic interactive information into a corresponding data unit in the static interactive data texture diagram to generate an interactive information mapping graph of the 3D scene. The invention also relates to a system for generating the interactive information in 3D scene rendering. The invention inserts a logic code used for generating human-computer interactive information data during the operation of a 3D scene rendering program based on a drawing engine, and generated interactive information is saved into a video memory and corresponds to screen coordinates of an original scene picture, thereby generating an additional interactive information mapping graph under the condition of not modifying an application program; and the graph provides basic data for an interactive information driving engine.
