The invention provides a quadrature mixer circuit of a switch unit with a quarter duty cycle, relating to the technical field of communication and overcoming the defects of great power consumption, miss match, low-frequency flash noise, secondary non-linear distortion, and the like existing in the prior art. The switch mixer circuit block of the invention comprises an I-path mixer subblock and a Q-path mixer subblock, either mixer subblock respectively comprises an anode switch unit group and a canoed switch unit group which are orthogonally and symmetrically arranged, each switch unit group comprises two quarter-duty-cycle switch units with a shared input end, each quarter-duty-cycle switch unit comprises two series-connected transistors, each transistor is provided with an LO (Local Oscillator) signal input electrode, and LO signals input by the two transistors in the same quarter-duty-cycle switch unit have the phase difference of pai/2 so that only one path is switched on in a path from an RF (Radio Frequency) to an IF (Internal Frequency) in every moment, therefore, the secondary non-linear distortion and the low-frequency flash noise are effectively solved, the miss match is lessened, and the current gain is increased.

The invention provides a phase frequency detector and charge pump circuit for a phase locked loop. The prior art has the defects of poor linearity and noise performance, so when a first series circuit is connected with the output end of a current pump, an upstream biasing circuit is used as a biasing circuit of an upstream current source; and when a second series circuit is connected with the output end of the current pump, a downstream biasing current source is used as a biasing circuit of a downstream current source. By adding the two fixed biasing currents and selecting proper biasing current according to the output voltage of the charge pump, phase difference of two input ends of the phase frequency detector deviates from zero after the PLL loop is locked, so that the aim of enhancing the linearity of the phase frequency detector and the charge pump and improving the noise performance of a fractional-N phase locked loop can be achieved.
