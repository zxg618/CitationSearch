Disclosed are a novel hepatitis A vaccine virus strain SH, a method for isolating the same, and a method for adapting the same to MRC-5 cells. The virus was isolated from the feces of a patient with an acute infection of hepatitis A and then transmitted to human diploid MRC-5 cells for adapted culture. In the adaptation process, the culture period for the early generation subculture was 35 days, and the culture period after the eighth passage was shortened to 24 days. With eight further passages, the antigen titer reached 1:512-1:1024, and the virus infectious titer reached 7.0-8.0lgCCID50/ml. Immunogenicity and cross protection assays showed that the hepatitis A inactivated vaccine produced from the virus strain has a good protective effect of immunogenicity. The virus strain is an ideal strain for the large-scale industrial production of hepatitis A inactivated vaccine.

The invention provides a new hepatitis A vaccine virus strain SH and a separation method as well as an MRC-5 cell adaptation method thereof. The virus is separated from excrement of a hepatitis A acute infection patient and is transferred to a diploid cell MRC-5 for adaptation culture. The virus strain SH is proved to be a hepatitis A virus through methods such as gene sequencing, neutralization test and the like; and during adaptation, early-generation sub-culturing period is 35 days, and culturing period is shortened to be 24 days after the strain is sub-cultured for 8 generations. After the strain is continuously cultured for 8 generations, antigen titer can reach (1:512)-(1:1,024), and the virus infection titer can reach 7.0 to 8.01gCCID50/ml. Immunogenicity tests and cross protection tests show that the strain has a good immunogenicity protection effect during production of a hepatitis A inactivated vaccine, is suitable for industrially producing the hepatitis A inactivated vaccine strain on a large scale and is an ideal strain for producing the hepatitis A inactivated vaccine.
