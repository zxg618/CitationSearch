The invention discloses a sensitive amplifier circuit applied to a semiconductor memory, with high speed, low voltage and low power consumption. The sensitive amplifier circuit comprises a high sensitive latch amplifying circuit, a precharge circuit and a rapid selective write-back circuit. A memory cell bit line is precharged to a proper electric potential by the precharge circuit, different states of the information in a memory can result in rapid response of bit line electric potential when reading data, and stored information is amplified to carry out subsequent treatment by the amplification of a high sensitivity sensitive amplifier. The circuit can also write information into the memory cell by selective write operation. The sensitive amplifier circuit of the invention can be appliedto various memory chips, and has simple circuit structure, low voltage, low power consumption, high sensitivity and high work reliability.
