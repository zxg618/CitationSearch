The present invention provides a method for preparing a genotype F mumps attenuated live vaccine. A mumps attenuated strain MHM-19 is inoculated to a human embryo lung diploid cell MHL-3 that is cultured to a monolayer, virus is released through the frozen-thawed cell in the peak of viral multiplication, cell debris is centrifuged and removed, a protective agent is added to a centrifuged virus suspension to obtain a semi-finished product of the vaccine, and the semi-finished product is frozen and dried to obtain the finished product of the genotype F mumps attenuated live vaccine. After the MHM-19 attenuated live vaccine prepared by the method of the present invention is injected into a rhesus monkey for immunizing, good humoral immunity is induced to be produced, and the detection results obtained at different time after immunization show that the MHM-19 attenuated live vaccine has immunizing potency superior to that of a reference mumps vaccine S79; in addition, the safety experiment shows that the rhesus monkey does not suffer from any parotitis-related symptom after being injected with the MHM-19 attenuated live vaccine, and the pathological tissue has no obvious difference from that of S79 strain by observing, so that the MHM-19 vaccine has high safety.

In the adaptation process, the culture period for the early generation subculture was 35 days, and the culture period after the eighth passage was shortened to 24 days. With eight further passages, the antigen titer reached 1:512-1:1024, and the virus infectious titer reached 7.0-8.0lgCCID50/ml. Immunogenicity and cross protection assays showed that the hepatitis A inactivated vaccine produced from the virus strain has a good protective effect of immunogenicity. The virus strain is an ideal strain for the large-scale industrial production of hepatitis A inactivated vaccine.
