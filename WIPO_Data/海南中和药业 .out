The invention relates to an acetic acid atosiban, and a method for detecting content of preparation of acetic acid atosiban and relevant substances. The detection method is an efficient liquid-phase chromatography method, which comprises the following chromatography conditions that a chromatographic column takes octadecylsilane chemically bonded silica (C18) as filling agent; 0.05mol/L phosphate buffer solution is taken as mobile phase A and acetonitrile as mobile phase B to carry out gradient elution; a detection wavelength ranges from 205 to 225nm; the flow speed ranges between 0.8 and 1.2ml/min and the concentration of a prepared sample ensures that each milliliter of the sample contains 0.1 to 15mg of polypeptide; and the sample size is controlled between 5 and 200mu l. The efficient liquid-phase chromatography method can accurately detect a sample and the content of impurities of the sample at the same time and realizes complete sample separation during analysis and ideal reproducibility of analysis result, thereby providing a simple and reliable method for quality control and analysis during production process.

The invention relates to a method for synthesizing atosiban by a solid phase, which comprises the following steps: 1) de-Fmoc-protecting Rink Amide resin serving as a carrier to obtain H2N-Rink Amide resin; 2) connecting carboxyl of Fmoc-Gly-OH and amino of the resin by using HOBT and DIPCI as condensation reagents to obtain Fmoc-Gly (resin); 3) solid-phase synthesizing sequence residue amino acid in turn by adopting Fmoc strategy; 4) performing solid-phase cyclization by using iodine; 5) then cutting the sequence residue amino acid by using pyrolysis reagents (trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole/1, 2-dimercaptoethane/water), and settling the sequence residue amino acid by diethyl ether to obtain raw atosiban peptide; and 6) treating the raw product through HPLC preparation and separation to obtain a pure atosiban product.
