The invention relates to application of neuregulin in the preparation of medicaments for preventing, treating or delaying ischemia reperfusion injuries of mammals, particularly human bodies. More particularly, the invention relates to a method for applying the neuregulin to prevent, treat or delay cardiac ischemia reperfusion injuries, and a composition for preventing, treating or delaying the cardiac ischemia reperfusion injuries. Specifically, although the neuregulin shows effects of improving cardiac muscle cell structures and improving cardiac functions in various cell experiments, animal experiments and clinical trials, whether the neuregulin influences the cardiac ischemia reperfusion injuries or not is not clear at present. Rat animal model experiments prove that the neuregulin can reduce infarction areas in the ischemia reperfusion process and prompt that the neuregulin can be used for preventing, treating or delaying the cardiac ischemia reperfusion injuries.

The invention relates to a device or a preparation containing neuregulin (NRG), the device or the preparation can carry out the long-term injection of the neuregulin to the blood of a mammal, thus leading the neuregulin to realize the sustained existence in the blood. Experiments prove that the NRG with the sustained existence in the blood can not only sustainedly activate a downstream signal conducting system thereof for a long time, but can also significantly improve the heart failure and the heart. The device for carrying out the long-term injection of the neuregulin to the blood of the mammal specifically comprises a container containing NRG solution, a matched injection system and a capsule-typed osmotic pump containing the NRG solution, and the preparation containing the NRG specifically comprises a coupling of the NRG and polyethylene glycol (PEG) or NRG-containing liposomes and microspheres, etc.

The trials of carrying out one time of intravenous injection of 2.99 to 35.83U/kg (protein/weight) of neuregulin to healthy people find that part of the people have negative reactions or ECG changes, but the negative reactions are disappeared after 8 hours, and the ECG is recovered to the normal state after 7 days. The cardiac function and the respiratory of all the research objects are always normal. The further trails of carrying out five times (once per day for 5 days) of injection of 2.99 to 17.92U/kg of the neuregulin to the healthy people are carried out, part of people also have the negative reactions or ECG changes, and the more the dosage of the protein, the higher the frequency of abnormal ECG is. But the negative reactors are disappeared rapidly, and the ECG can be recovered to the normal state after 7 days of the final injection. The 2.99 to 35.83U/kg of the neuregulin is believed be used as the safe dosage for the people according to the results of clinical trails.
