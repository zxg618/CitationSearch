The invention relates to a preparation method of carboxylated lignin, belonging to the fields of new low-carbon preparation technology of new materials and cyclic reutilization of renewable resources. The method of the invention comprises the following steps: pressing air into an air distributor in a reaction kettle by utilizing an air compressor; fully and uniformly mixing the air with lignin liquor under the condition of stirring; and under the aid of a composite catalyst, reacting at 50-140 DEG C under 0.02-1.0MPa for 30-480 minutes to obtain the carboxylated lignin, wherein the dosage of the composite catalyst is 0.01-5.0wt.% of the dry weight of the lignin; the composite catalyst at least contains more than one transition metal salt and at least contains one rare earth metal salt, and the mol ratio range of the transition metal salt to the rare earth element salt is 3:1-20:1; and the number of the air distributor is at least one, and the air distributor is a plurality of perforated pipes the pore diameter of which gradually increases from top to bottom and the pore number of which gradually decreases. The invention can carry out reasonable adjustment and control on molecular chains, chain structures and functional groups thereon of the lignin and reduce the cost.

The invention relates to a method for extracting lignin from papermaking black liquor, which comprises: adjusting the pH value of the papermaking black liquor to 8-10, pre-treating by a pretreatment system, and removing the big suspended particles and colloid impurities; the pretreatment system is a mechanical oscillation screen filter or a bay type filter with filtration accuracy of 100-300 mu, and a modified separating film with retention molecular weight of 2-5 hundred thousand; The modified separating film material is processed by body grafting modification, surface grafting modification or alloying modification; by fine filtering through two stages or more separating films, the separating film retention molecular weight ranges from 150 to 5000. The lignin content in the product of the invention is no less than 55% and can be more than 90.0% after concentration and purification; it can endure the temperature of more than 130 degrees centigrade; the apparent ash content can be less than 5%; and the molecular weight and distribution can be adjusted to produce the lignin product with different qualities; and water can be fully circulated and utilized.
