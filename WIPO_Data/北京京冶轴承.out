The invention relates to a permanent magnet suspension bearing, which comprises an inner ring (1), an outer ring (2), a first radial permanent magnet (3) and a plurality of axial permanent magnets (4), wherein the outer ring (2) is a permanent magnet, the inner ring is sleeved in the outer ring, the inner diameter of the outer ring is larger than the outer diameter of the inner ring, and the thickness of the outer ring along the axial direction is smaller than the thickness of the inner ring along the axial direction; the first radial permanent magnet is fixed on the inner ring and is attracted with the outer ring through magnetic force along the radial direction; and the axial permanent magnets are fixed on two end surfaces of the inner ring so as to make the outer ring be in a force balance state along the axial direction. The invention also provides an installation structure of the permanent magnet suspension bearing. The installation structure also comprises an auxiliary bearing (8), a fixed shaft (14) and a hollow rotary shaft (15). The permanent magnet suspension bearing and the installation structure thereof disclosed by the invention are more suitable for the working occasion in which the inner ring is a stator and the outer ring is a rotor.
