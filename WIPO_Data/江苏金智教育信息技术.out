The invention discloses an intelligent prompt method, an intelligent prompt module and an intelligent prompt system for search. According to the method disclosed by the invention, a server executes the following steps of distinguishing prefix words and suffix words by a tokenizer; carrying out synonymy expansion to form a prefix synonym list and a suffix synonym list; then traversing a hot word suffix tree to search hot words of prefix matches and/or suffix matches to obtain candidate words; and analyzing and calculating probability of each candidate word by historical search behaviors of a user. According to the method, a client executes the following steps of calculating load relevance of each candidate word; and calculating a click-on predicted value of each candidate word and then selecting the candidate words to display according to the click-on predicted values. In the invention, prompt words are obtained by matching between the prefix words and the suffix words, synonyms are combined, mass of search intentions of the user are integrated and the local relevance is combined, so that the prompt words are more approximate to the search intentions of the user.
