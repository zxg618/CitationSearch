The invention discloses a harmless minimization bio-treatment method for organic waste. The method comprises the following steps: (1) adding a complex enzyme for pre-treatment of the organic waste; (2) heating for inactivating the complex enzyme; and (3) adding a microbial agent for after-treatment of the organic waste. The method of the invention performs the treatments of decomposing the organic waste with bio-enzymes and decomposing the organic waste with microorganisms separately. After the organic waste is decomposed by the bio-enzymes, the enzymes are inactivated by heating, and then the microbial agent is added to decompose the organic waste, thereby avoiding the situation that the bio-enzymes destroy the microorganisms when the bio-enzymes and the microbial agent are mixed. The method has short treatment time for organic waste and high efficiency. The weight of the organic waste is decreased by 85%-90%. The treated residue is pale brown, scentless and can be used as fuel, feedstuff or raw material for organic fertilizer.

The invention discloses a method for retanning leather by using bioenzyme, and in particular relates to reinforcement of a spatial structure of collagen by using the bioenzyme. The method is applied to a retanning process after a main tanning process. In the retanning process, transglutaminase is applied to the catalyzing of crosslinking in molecules and between the molecules of the collagen, so that physical and chemical indexes such as thermal stability, tear strength, fullness and the like of the leather are further improved. An application process comprises the following steps of: adding a certain amount of bioenzyme, namely 0.5 to 2U of bioenzyme, into every gram of dry blue leather which is tanned by the conventional process at the bath ratio of 1:0.6-1:0.9, the temperature of between 30 and 40 DEG C and the pH value of between 5.0 and 8.0; and treating in a revolving drum for 60 minutes. The tear strength, the fullness and the extensibility of the treated leather are correspondingly improved compared with those of untreated raw leather.
