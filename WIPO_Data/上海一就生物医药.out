The invention provides an expression plasmid pAmk and a downstream gene sequence form of the fused promoter in the expression plasmid. The example that pAmk is used to express foreign protein proinsulin is adopted to introduce the characteristic of the expression system of the invention. The invention provides a method that starting plasmid pAmk is used to construct the expression plasmid, the expression plasmid is converted into the expression host bacteria and the induction expression of lactose is used to produce the foreign protein.

The invention provides a molecule (Preproinsulin) of human proinsulin with a novel N-terminal expressed peptide sequence or analogs of the human proinsulin, a method for producing human insulin by using the molecule, and processes for building related expression vectors and engineering cells and expressing and purifying human proinsulin. The DNA sequence of the human proinsulin coded by the N-terminal expressed peptide sequence or the analogs of the human proinsulin is first introduced into a prokaryotic expression vector and then transferred into an escherichia coli to express the molecule in form of an inclusion body. The invention has the advantages that: the product has high expression amount and is easy to purify; the preparation method avoids the use of CNBr; and the process for processing the recombinant insulin is simple.
