The invention discloses a method for controlling cadmium accumulated in leaf vegetables in contaminated soils, which relates to the field of recovery of plants contaminated by heavy metals in the soils and safety of agricultural products in environmental protection. In the method provided by the invention, the optimal harvesting time of the vegetable planted in the cadmium contaminated soil is judged by utilizing the number of leaves; when plant recovery is performed on the leaf vegetable, like lettuce, planted in the low-concentration cadmium contamination-containing soil, the vegetable has relatively more biomass accumulation and can be harvested when having 16 leaves, so the plant recovery efficiency is improved; and when the leaf vegetable planted in the cadmium contamination-containing soil is eaten as the agricultural product, the vegetable can be harvested not in a period when the vegetable has 16 leaves but in a vigorous growth period when the vegetable has about 12 leaves, so the safety of the agricultural product is ensured. The method has the advantages of optimizing the plant recovery efficiency of the cadmium contaminated soil and simultaneously producing important influences on the safety of the agricultural products in the low-concentration cadmium contamination-containing soils, along with convenience, quickness, no loss and no damage to samples.

The invention relates to phytoremediation technology in a heavy metal contamination environment, in particular to a method for remediating cadmium contaminated soil by using an ornamental plant smooth joyweed. In the method, the smooth joyweed (preserved in National Crop Germplasm Conservation Center, and the variety name is J589193) is planted on cadmium contaminated soil (including wet land), and a great amount of cadmium in the contaminated soil is absorbed through the root system of the smooth joyweed and is transferred to an overground part of the plant. When the plant grows to the end of the growing period or the biomass of the overground part is maximum, the overground part of the plant is moved away from the contaminated soil and is subjected to proper treatment, and the aim of continuously extracting and removing cadmium from the soil is fulfilled by repeatedly planting the plant and repeating the process. By remediating and treating the cadmium contaminated soil by using the enriched plant smooth joyweed, the method has the advantages of high efficiency, low cost, high operability, easy popularization and application, no damage to soil structure, no secondary contamination and the like, and also has good effect on soil erosion prevention and landscaping in contaminated fields.
