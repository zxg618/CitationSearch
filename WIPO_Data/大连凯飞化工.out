The invention relates to an organic compound synthesis method, in particular to a sulfonic chloride methyl phenylpropionate synthesis method. The method comprises the following steps: firstly, esterifying benzene propanoic acid and sulfonating the esterified benzene propanoic acid with chlorosulfonic acid; then, hydrolyzing the sulfonated benzene propanoic acid to separate out solid, and drying, recrystallizing and refining the product to be the sulfonic chloride methyl phenylpropionate. Compared with a similar synthesis method, the invention has the advantages of low-price and easily-obtained raw materials, simple and short reaction process route, easily controlled process conditions and optimal performance, high purity and high yield of the prepared final product, is suitable for industrialized production and meets the quality requirements of medicine production.

The present invention relates to a preparation method of an organic compound, in particular to a method used for synthesizing 2, 3, 4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-1, 4-benzodiazepine. The raw materials of o-halogen benzyl halogen and ethylene have mixing reaction in an organic solvent; the intermediate product of N-(2-benzyl) ethylene diamine can be prepared after separation and purification; then the intermediate product is dissolved in the system of ring-closing agents; under the condition with a catalyst, the final product can be prepared through ring-closing reaction. Compared with the synthetic method in the prior art, the preparation method of the 2, 3, 4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-1, 4-benzodiazepine has the significant advantages of simple synthetic process, wide range of technical conditions, safe and easy operation, environmentally friendly operation, cheap and easily available raw materials, great decrease of the production cost, high yield of the final product, high purity of the product, and broader application prospects.
