The invention discloses a method for preparing trimeric sodium phosphate by composite phosphate dry powder, which relates to a method for preparing the trimeric sodium phosphate. The method comprises the steps of: calculating the mole number of sodium oxide needed by unit mass of the composite phosphate dry powder according to the molar ratio of the sodium oxide to phosphorus pentoxide being 5:3; directly adding the composite phosphate dry powder into an alkaline liquor containing the needed mole number of the sodium oxide in a mixing tank with a stirrer; mixing the alkaline liquor with the composite phosphate dry powder to react under the stirring; completely dissolving the dry powder to obtain feed liquid by utilizing the reaction heat, and then directly spraying the feed liquid into a polymerization furnace for dehydration and polycondensation to obtain the trimeric sodium phosphate; or preparing the feed liquid into a dry material in a spray drying tower, and then entering the polymerization furnace for dehydration and polycondensation into the trimeric sodium phosphate. The method has the advantages that: 1, the method is scientific and reasonable, and has concise operation; 2, the method is energy-saving and water-saving; and 3, compared with equal-scale production devices, the method relatively improves the actual production capacity due to the fact that the polymerization time is shortened. The method is applicable to related phosphorus chemical enterprises.

The invention discloses a method for preparing high purity sodium formate with the tail gas of a yellow phosphorus furnace; the tail gas of the yellow phosphorus furnace is firstly purified, and then reacts with alkali liquor to synthesize sodium formate. The invention is characterized in that the wet PDS is adopted for desulphurization; the desulphurized tail gas enters into a decarburization device, and PSA variable pressure is used for adsorption and decarburization; the purified tail gas reacts with alkali liquor under the conditions of 2.3-2.5 Mpa and 230 DEG C to synthesize sodium formate. The process can be described as follows: firstly the tail gas of the yellow phosphorus furnace is washed with first class water, pumped out by a water ring pump, and delivered to a second class water washing tower and a floating ball type water washing tower, and then delivered to a coke filter to filter the solid impurities and enters into a adsorber and a desulphurization tower; the desulphurized gas is delivered to the first part and the second part of a compressor, and then delivered to the decarburization device after being pressurized; the decarburized gas is delivered to the third part of the compressor, and pressurized to obtain purified feed gas which can react with the alkali liquor in a synthesizer to synthesize the sodium formate. The invention can realizes that the device for preparing high purity sodium formate with the tail gas of a yellow phosphorus furnace can run in large-scale, cleaning and long period, and is suitable to be used for the enterprises preparing high purity sodium formate with the tail gas of the yellow phosphorus furnace.
