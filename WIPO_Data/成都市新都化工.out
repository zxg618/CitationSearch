PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a new method and apparatus for recovering a metal from an adsorbent on which the metal ion has been adsorbed. SOLUTION: The method includes a step (i) of applying voltage between a first and a second electrode 21 and 22 so that the first electrode 21 becomes a cathode, the electrode 21 and 22 being arranged so as to be in contact with a material in which ion is movable. The material includes an adsorbent (gel 11) containing a high polymer on which the metal ion has been adsorbed. The high polymer contains a structural unit same as that of a high polymer extracted from phylloderma sacrum. In the step (i), the first electrode 21 is arranged so as to be in contact with the adsorbent. The metal is deposited on the surface of the first electrode 21 by the application of voltage in the step (i). COPYRIGHT: (C)2011,JPO&INPIT

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide an acoustic board which is light in weight, high in acoustic properties, and maintains the acoustic properties in an outdoor environment. SOLUTION: The acoustic board (1) is formed of an acoustic section (2) and a casing (5). The acoustic section (2) is formed by perforating a number of bores (4) in a board body (3) made of an organic polymer material, aluminum, or impregnated paper or resin-coated paper with waterproofness. The casing (5) covers upper and lower surfaces, side surfaces, and a rear surface of the acoustic section which has a bulk specific gravity of 0.14. A number of the bores (4) are aligned in longitudinal and transverse directions, but they may be arranged in a suitable manner including a zigzag manner or at random. The length of each cylindrical hole, i.e. the length (depth) of each bore (4) is varied by continuously changing the thickness of the acoustic board. Thus, resonance of the cylindrical holes (single-side-closed air cylinder) caused by the holes (4) is generated, and a frequency band of a sound absorbing object can be set.

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To reduce the space necessary for the work in the production of a lightweight cellular concrete plate having coated surface, decrease the number of operators, save the energy and reduce the cost. SOLUTION: An ALC plate 1 forming a lightweight cellular concrete plate is heated in a heating process 2 to adjust the water-content of the ALC plate 1 and keep the surface temperature to 40-60C. The surface of the plate is coated in a coating process 3 keeping the above state and left standing for about 3 min in an impregnation process 4. The coating material and water constituting the coating film formed on the surface of the ALC plate 1 are impregnated into the pore formed near the surface of the ALC plate 1 to increase the coating material concentration in the coating film and effect the fixing of the film. At the same time, the heat of the ALC plate 1 is transmitted to the water to evaporate the water. The drying of the coating film is accelerated by the above two factors. Accordingly, the present process enables the rational production of a coated lightweight cellular concrete plate at a reduced cost. COPYRIGHT: (C)2001,JPO

SOLUTION: A three-dimensional radiation incident position detector is provided with a plurality of pillar-shaped scintillators and with photodetectros 321 to 324 which are connected to respective bottom faces of the plurality of pillar-shaped scintillators. In the plurality of pillar-shaped scintillators, a plurality of scintillator cells 301, 302 and the like having a prescribed shape are piled up in the up-and-down direction. The plurality of pillar-shaped scintillators are arranged in such a way that their mutual side faces are adjacent, and the side faces of at least the uppermost-stage scintillator celles out of the adjacent side faces are adjacent so that light comes and goes mutually.

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To smooth the supply of gas to a cathode surface and to enable the production of sodium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, etc., under a low electrolytic voltage by disposing a hydrophilic liquid permeable material between an ion exchange membrane and a gas diffusion cathode. SOLUTION: The sodium hydroxide is formed on the cathode chamber 14 side surface of the ion exchange membrane 12 when a current is supplied while a satd. brine is supplied to an anode chamber 13 and oxygen-contg. gas to a cathode chamber 14. At this time, the hydrophilic material 16 exists between the ion exchange membrane 12 and the gaseous oxygen diffusion cathode 17 and, therefore, the aq. sodium hydroxide soln. is diffused in the hydrophilic material 16 having the resistance lower than the resistance under which the aq. soln. passes the inside of the cathode 17. This aq. soln. is lowered particularly by gravity until the aq. soln. arrives at the bottom end of the hydrophilic material 16 and is stored in the bottom of the cathode chamber 14. Then, the taking of the formed aq. soln. out of the reaction site is executed by the dispersion in the hydrophilic material of the relatively small resistance and since the stagnation thereof in the cathode is substantially prevented, the supply problem of the reactive gases is solved and the reaction efficiency is highly maintained.

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To sufficiently hold adhesion of an adhesive tape for fixing a mat by providing an adhesive part for sticking the adhesive tape on a lower face of an upper deck board facing a fork insertion port and between a deck board end rim and a lateral rib parallel to the end rim. SOLUTION: A tape adhesive part 19 is provided in the vicinity of an intermediate pillar 15 of an upper deck board 10 and a lower deck board 11. The tape adhesive part 19 is surrounded by the intermediate pillar 15, a longitudinal rib 23 and a lateral rib 25, wherein a part of a top plate 21 has a thickness same as a height of an end rim rib 25a, and a plurality of small holes for facilitating peeling of the tape are drilled. An adhesive face 28 of the tape adhesive part 19 is formed on a horizontal face approximately in parallel to the top plate 21 of the upper deck board. Therefore when the longitudinal rib 23 is removed, an adhesive area increases with the adhesive face 28 of the tape adhesive part 19 as a horizontal face, as well as contact of a fork can be prevented. In addition, insertion of the fork is guided along a gradient face of the longitudinal rib 23. COPYRIGHT: (C)1998,JPO

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To shift it from any direction by placing hand, and also, carry it by embracing by a method wherein on a top plate, a hand placing hole is provided, and for the hand placing hole, at one part or the whole part of the rim of a through hole of a size in which hand can be inserted, a hand placing rib is formed on the lower surface of the top plate. SOLUTION: For an upper deck board 3, a hand placing hole 17 is provided on a top plate 11, and a reinforcing rib is provided in the lengthwise and crosswisre direction on the lower surface of the top plate 11. For the hand placing hole 17, at a location which is closer to the pallet center than one fourth of the length dimension from the pallet end surface from either direction of a cross direction (x) or a depth direction (y), a rectangular through hole 17a in which hand can be inserted, is provided, and at one part or the whole part of the rim of the through hole 17a, a hand placing rib 17b is formed by lowering the height of one part, on the lower surface of the top plate 11. Therefore, the balance when being lifted is favorable, a force can be easily applied to the hand, and the pallet can be lifted or shifted by placing hand, and the arrangement and the storage work of the pallet can be efficiently and safely performed.

PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To promote the non-slip effect and risibility for a non-slip pavement without incurring cost by using scale-like glass crushing powder with specific particle size and aggregate at specific weight ratio to scatter them on the surface thereof. SOLUTION: A glass residual material of soda glass is crushed, and scale-like glass crushing powder with 0.5-6mm of particle size is manufactured. This glass crushing pieces are mixed with aggregate such as emery, ceramic burning aggregate, crushed stone, etc., at weight ratio of 1/9-7/3 as a usage percentage. Road is coated with a binder such as epoxy resin, etc. Scale-like glass crushing portion and aggregate are scattered before coated film is solidified or hardened. Because of the scale-like crushing powder, the effect of non-slip is improved, and non-slip pavement with the high effect of legibility can be executed at low cost. COPYRIGHT: (C)1998,JPO
