The invention is a kind of digital certification confidence domain spanning mutual connection method, which belongs to computer and information security technology field. The invention uses certification applied gateway, at first, the user applies the certification between the two confidence domains, there has two digital certifications which two are a digital certification an and a certification b, the two certifications accord the X.509V3 standards certification format, and uses the same personal key structure, which are signed with two confidence domains CA, thus realizes the certification conversion, data transmission through the gateway, namely that the gateway receives the digital certification an and the correspondent SSL protocol package, replaces the digital certification b and the correspondent SSL protocol is transmitted to the safe certification gateway, thus the certification a can be converted into the digital certification b, the certification application gateway can be used to testify the digital certification a.

The invention comprises two parts: 'geer' SSL gateway and 'geer' SSL PLUS. Application flow is as follows. (1) Developing and completing SSL gateway device independent from WEB application server, access from user to WEB application must be passed through SSL gateway device; in access procedure from user to WEB application, safety connection based on SSL protocol is built between client end and SSL gateway so as to guarantee secure transmission between them. (2) 'geer' SSL PLUS provides conversion module for authentication information, implementing conversion from user certificate to user' name and password. Security is strengthened for WEB application to utilize SSL without necessaries to make any modifying mode of logging in and authentication of user's name and password. The invention shortens period for strengthening application security, reduces modifying cost. The product is independent and easy to be debugged.

The present invention adopts the separation method of certificate information from attribute information, the portion tightly combined with application in the original certificate information is extracted, and can be used as attribute information. Said attribute information can ensure authority by means of signature of CA mechanism, and has several storage modes, at the same time the digital certificate is the identification and certification of unique identity of entity. After separation of digital certificate from attribute information their service management can adopt more flexible mode so as to utilize different properties of digital certificate and attribute information, and utilizes the attribute information issue, entity certificate issue, certificate cancel and attribute information application so as to implement combination, cross-application and intercommunication of entity certificate and attribute information.
