The invention relates to a preparation method of electrolyte of vanadium battery. The raw material of the invention is a coal mineral containing vanadium which is commonly used and easy to exploit. The mineral is roasted with strong alkaline sodium-calcium salt-mixture, and then valadium is leached out aqueously. A high purity VOSO4 solution can be obtained by impurity removing, reduction, vanadium precipitation of VO2.XH2O and dissolving VO2.XH2O in vitriol. When the ore source is distant from an electrolyte using site, the vanadium can be leached with less water and added with ammonia water. Crude ammonia metavanadate residue containing about 10 percent V205 is transported to the using site to carry out technique treatments like impurity removing and reduction etc. The high purity VOSO4 solution is used for electrolyte of vanadium battery after being electrolytic reducted and added with required additive. The invention does not relate to a content of the electrolytic reduction and the additive. No sodium chloride is composed in the strong alkaline sodium-calcium salt-mixture and no chlorine is generated in the roasting process. Calcium sulphate is formed by the combination of calcium salt and sulfur, which reduces the emission of SO2 and is environmental friendly. The roasting with strong alkaline increases the conversion rate and the yield rate of vanadium and enhances economic benefits. The roasting with strong alkaline also provides a PH value over 14 when adding ammonia water to the leaching of the vanadium, and reduces impurity ions such as manganese ion and iron ion getting into the vanadium solution and is beneficial for the followed purification process. The invention also adopts a preparation method of vanadium solution after purification: vanadium is precipitated in the form of VO2.XH2O, the VO2.XH2O is dissolved by sulfuric acid, and turned into high purity VOSO4 solution as the raw material of the electrolyte of vanadium battery.
