The invention relates to a method and a system for uniformly depositing films. A plasma reactor contains a plurality of negative electrodes driven by external power sources. In the process of PECVD, radio frequency or ultra-high frequency electrical energy is periodically supplied to the negative electrodes in a pulse mode, the pulse frequency is from 300 Hz to 50 kHz, and the pulse width is smaller than or equal to the half period. The pulse peaks (opening status) of the pulse power applied to adjacent negative electrodes are staggered mutually. When the power source of a negative electrode is in an opening status, the power source of an adjacent negative electrode is in a closing status, the plasma regions driven by the power sources are excited asynchronously, and thus the disturbance between two adjacent plasma regions is avoided. When the pulse width is controlled to be narrower, the pulse opening status time control can be extended to a plurality of adjacent electrodes. The invention greatly improves the depositing uniformity and the depositing repeatability, and reduces the possibility of formation of particles or powder in the radio frequency PECVD process. The invention is particularly suitable for a large plasma reaction chamber which is synchronously deposited on a large base plate and contains a plurality of parallel electrodes.
