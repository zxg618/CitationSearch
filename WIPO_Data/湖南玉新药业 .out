The invention provides a preparation method of betamethasone acetate and comprises the following steps: 1) with ammonium salt as the catalytic agent, 17Alpha-hydroxyl-9, 11Beta-epoxy-16Beta-methyl pregna-1, 4-diene-3 and 20-diketone are reacted with brominated reagent; the liquid and the solid elements are separated, liquid phantom is collected and dissolvent is abandoned, thereby obtaining the intermediate compound; and 2) the dissolvent is added with the intermediate compound, acetate, and the phase transfer catalyst of catalytic amount to react, and then the target product is collected from the reaction product. In the method, the reaction condition is moderate, the reaction yield is high, the purity can reach more than 99 percent, the reagent is easy to get, and the dissolvent can be reused, thereby being convenient for industrialization implement.

The invention provides a preparation method of the 17 beta- hydroxy-7alpha-carboxyl-3- oxo-17alpha-pregna-4, 9(11)-diene-21-carboxylic acid-gamma-lactone; the starting material of the invention is delta9 (11)- risperidone; with the use of the CuB or CuB2, the starting material reacts with the alkenyl halogenated magnesium; then with the solvent, the mixture of the ozone and oxygen takes part in the reaction; the peracid is added in, then the target product can be collected from the reaction products. The invention can get the product of the higher purity with a higher collection rate and a higher selectivity; the method is simple and safe; the purification is convenient; the invention greatly lowers the production cost. The environmental pollution is little and thus the invention facilitates the implementation of the industrialization.
