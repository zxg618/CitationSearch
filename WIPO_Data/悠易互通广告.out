The invention discloses a large-scale data retrieving system. The system mainly comprises an inverted file module, a data interface module, a searching module, a word segmentation module, a score function module and a process daemon protection module, wherein the inverted file module ensures that a retrieving system can quickly find a file list corresponding to a searching word; the data interface module encapsulates a visiting method for each datum to be disclosed; the searching module is used for retrieving by utilizing an input end searching condition, calculating intersection for the file list corresponding to each key word; the word segmentation module is used for segmenting words and obtaining each key word to form a searching tree; the score function module is responsible for station clustering to obtain a clustered searching result; and the process daemon protection module is used for accepting the searching request and returning the result according to the appointed maximum return result value in the searching request. By utilizing the system, the cost for visiting disks can be reduced, the number of floating point operation times is reduced through certain effective preprocessing, and the retrieving efficiency is further improved.

The invention discloses a web-based text classification mining system and a web-based text classification mining method. The system mainly comprises a text pre-processing module, a word segmentation processing module and a classification algorithm module, wherein the text pre-processing module is used for automatically screening specific information from texts to be tested, pre-processing the specific information, and filtering out irrelevant information to effectively represent the texts; the word segmentation processing module is used for carrying out word segmentation on the texts, finding attributes/attributive words of each text, and making preparation for selection of characteristic words; and the classification algorithm module is used for carrying out characteristic selection to obtain an optimum characteristic sub-set, or finding corresponding probabilities according to data which is provided by a file of a training result, comparing the corresponding probabilities to obtain the type of the maximum probability, drawing a conclusion and storing the conclusion in the file finally. The system overcomes the shortcoming of conditional independence assumption of a naive Bayes algorithm by using a hypertext markup language (HTML) tag weight, improves a classifier and can improve the recall ratio and precision ratio of data mining.
