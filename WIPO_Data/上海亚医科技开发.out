The invention provides a method for synthesizing piperazine of levofloxacin and belongs to the technical field of medicine synthetics. The method solves the problem that the levofloxacin piperazine reaction requires a high boiling point solvent and the polar solvents such as DMSO, triethylamine, pyridine, and the like have strong smell and strong pungency which are harmful to the health of human. The method comprises the following steps of: A) adding N-methyl piperazine in lavo-ofloxacin carboxylic acid to react and concentrating and recycling N-methyl piperazine after finishing the reaction so as to obtain residue, and B) adding water in the residue, and then adding alkali to neutralize so as to obtain the crude products of lavo-ofloxacin after filtering. The method of the invention does not use the high boiling point solvent like DMSO and the organic base like triethylamine or pyridine, so the smell is slight during the production process, the pungency is soft and the damage on the environment and the harm to the health of human are greatly decreased.
