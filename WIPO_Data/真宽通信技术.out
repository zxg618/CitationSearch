The invention relates to a cable television network bidirectional accessing derive which belongs to the field of communication technology. The device comprises an ONU module, an EoC module and a power supplying module. The ONU module is connected to the EoC module via the system bus connecting cable; and the ONU module and the EoC module are simultaneously connected to the power supplying module; the power supplying module is connected with a power source outside; a single optical fiber is accessed by the ONU module; the input end of the EoC module is connecting the external coaxial cable. The device can implement the transceiving only by a single-core optical fiber. The power source module can select 220V alternative municipal current for the power supplying, also can select coaxial cable 60V alternative feeding for the power supplying, simultaneously achieving the management for the devices on the different physical medium for one network managing software. The device can rapidly move the data on the frequency which is badly influenced by the noise to the other frequency to achieve the quick bandwidth recovery after the noise is happened.
